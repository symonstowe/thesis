\chapter{Internal Electrode Motion}
\label{chap:chapter-7}
\section{Introduction}
As discussed in \fref{sec:bioimpedance}, there are several factors that contribute towards
the cardiosynchronous signal in EIT. One of the largest conributions 
if movement; both the movment of 
body structures and the movement of electrodes contribute significantly to the measured
impedance and the resulting reconstructed 
image~\parencite{adler_origins_2017,proenca_influence_2015}.
The previous chapters support that more accurate meshing and internal electrodes may
help to identify the movement of structures and organs, reduing their impact on the 
reconstructed images, but the probelm of electrode motion is amplified when internal
electrodes are used. 
Internal electrodes placed on a probe are challenging to locate within a subject
due to difference in individual geometries. Incorrectly modelling the electrode 
locations can introduce an artefact in the image~\parencite{boyle_impact_2011}, 
but in time difference EIT these effects ar minimized~\parencite{adler_electrical_2017}. 
The larger problem apears 
to be the 
movement of the internal probe relative to the external electrodes between
measurements. 
Movement correction algorithms using the movement jacobian have been 
designed in 2D 
and 3D~\parencite{gomez-laberge_direct_2007,soleimani_imaging_2006,gomez-laberge_direct_2008}
and used to reconstruct electrode movement on 3D models with a 2D arrangement 
of electrodes~\parencite{boyle_geophysical_2016}. 
There are several available methods to calculate the movement 
jacobian~\parencite{boyle_methods_2017}, the simplest of which,
the na\"{i}ve perturbation method~\parencite{gomez-laberge_direct_2008},
has been used here as a proof of concept.  
A more detailed explanation of this jacobian calculation method is presented in 
\fref{sec:motion_correction} of the background.
As an internal probe is moved towards one side of the model the distance between the 
probe and the external electrodes changes. This results less impedance where the distance 
has decreased, and a higher impednace where the distance has increased. Without knowing 
the new probe location we can minimize the effect of this error, but there still remains 
a missmatch between the modeled and actual probe locations. 
The artefact that is present can give hints regarding the motion of electrodes
although it can be difficult to seperate the effect of electrode movement 
from biological impedance changes of interest~\parencite{boyle_geophysical_2016}. 
This chapter presents a method that builds on current algorithms 
available to compensate for electrode movement, to create a new, corrected model
that helps to correct for the effect of electrode location.  
The known shape of the artefact due to movement of the probe is used to 
derive the probe location, and create a corrected model to improve 
reconstruction accuracy in the presence of probe motion.

The goal of this chapter is to establish a technique to reduce the impact of probe movment on 
image reconstructions, and then to use this technique in an animal model. 
Although simulations in 2D and now in 3D show that internal electrodes can provide 
a desireable increase in sensitivity, the benefit has not been realized in real-world
recordings. 
This chapter presents a novel method to correct for electrode displacement artefact, 
and compares established techniqes for 3D EIT image reconstruction 
to reconstructions with the novel internal electrode approach in a limited number of 
subjects.

\section{Methods}
This chapter consists of two experiments: a simulation study correcting for probe motion 
in a tank model, and preliminary \emph{in-vivo} recordings that were conducted as an 
addition to another experimental protocol. 

\subsection{Simulations}
Simulations were done using EIDORS (v3.10)~\parencite{adler_eidors_2017}
meshes were generated using Netgen (version 5.3.1)~\parencite{schoberl_netgen_1997}
with Matlab 2019b (Matworks, Natick, MA, USA).

\subsubsection{Tank models}
A model of a tank with 28 external electrodes placed in twp planes of 14
evenly around the exterior
and 4 internal electrodes was created. 
The tank radius and height were 1 m, and the external eletrode radius was 5cm. 
The external electrode planes were placed at a height of 0.3 m and 0.7 m on the tank. 
The internal electrodes were spaced evenly between the external electrode planes 
at 0.3 m, 0.433 m, 0.567 m and 0.7m. The internal electrodes were specified in 
2 different ways. The first used spheres with a radius of 2.5 cm, and the second 
used a hollow cylinder with a radius of 2.5 cm containing cylindrical electrodes
with a radius of 2.5 cm and a height of 5 cm. 
Both models are shown in \fref{fig:probe_types}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter7-internal_elec_motion/imgs/probe_types.pdf} 
   \caption[Spherical and cylindrical internal electrodes]{\label{fig:probe_types} 
   On the left (A) internal electrodes were modelled as 4 shperical electrodes between the 
   external electrode planes. On the right (B) the intenal electrodes were created using 
   a hole through the center of the model and using cylindrical electrodes on the inner 
   surface of the model.
	The conductive region was specified by setting the conductiviy of all elements 
	contained in the target to be twice the background conductivitiy.}
\end{figure}

These models were compared to confirm that both 
performed adequately with motion correction, as internal electrodes 
are challengine to model and many different techniques are used. 
When using internal electrodes on a complex model, it is currently easiest 
to add electrodes along a hollow tube cut though the model. 

To specify a conductive region elements within a radius were assigned a conductivity 
of twice the background conductivitiy of the tank model.
The conductive target was placed midway between the center of the tank and the boundary
and the probe. The radius of the target was 20 cm. 
\Fref{fig:probe_types} shows the conductive target for both internal probe types.

\subsubsection{Measurements}
Despite sensitivity advantages ascribed to custom injection and 
measurement patterns, the skip 4 pattern was used as it 
is straight forward to implement with currently available EIT systems. 

Reference measurements were made with no conductive object and 
electrodes in the center of the model. Measurements with a conductive object were made 
with the probe centered, then
with the probe was shifted by 1, 5, and 10 percent of the tank radius in a randomized 
direction. The direction was randomized between trials but was consistent for 
each of the 1, 5 and 10 percent probe error models that was compared. 

\subsection{Movement correction}
\label{sec:3_methods}

The movement correction jacobian was calculated using the methods presented by
~\citeauthorandyear{gomez-laberge_direct_2008}. In a model with a centered electrode
probe and uniform conductivity, each of the 4 electrodes on the probe was
perturbed by 0.001 m in each of the $\mathbf x$, $\mathbf y$, 
and $\mathbf z$ directions. A measurement was made for 
each electrode and each of the 3 dimenstions of movement. 
The reslting measuremts were divided by the pertubation 
amount. 
The measurements on each electrode ($V_j$) and from each  direction 
of movement ($\mathbf x$, $\mathbf y$, 
and $\mathbf z$) were combined to form the movement 
jacobian ($J_M$) using the following equation from
\citeauthorandyear{gomez-laberge_direct_2008}:
\begin{equation}
	J_M = \left[ 
		  \frac{\partial\mathbf{V}_j}{\partial\mathbf{x}},
		  \frac{\partial\mathbf{V}_j}{\partial\mathbf{y}},
	      \frac{\partial\mathbf{V}_j}{\partial\mathbf{z}} ... 
		  \frac{\partial\mathbf{V}_n}{\partial\mathbf{x}},
		  \frac{\partial\mathbf{V}_n}{\partial\mathbf{y}},
	      \frac{\partial\mathbf{V}_n}{\partial\mathbf{z}} 
		  \right]
\end{equation}

This movenent jacobian was used in conjunction with the following single step 
formulation for a reconstruction matrix presented 
by \citeauthorandyear{adler_impedance_1994}. The regular impedance based 
reconstruction matrix is denoted by $R_C$ and the jacobian for impedance based 
reconstruction is denoted by $J_C$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:regular_rm}
	R_C = \frac{[J_C]^T [W]}{[J_C] [W] [J_C]^T + [W]}
\end{equation}

$W$ in the above equation represents the laplace prior~\parencite{soleimani_imaging_2006}.
Combining this formulation with the movement jacobian yeilds the following equation 
for the reconstruction matrix ($R_M$)~\parencite{soleimani_imaging_2006} where $R_M$
denotes the reconstruction matrix for motion correction:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:motion_rm}
	R_M = \frac{[J_C]^T [W]}{[J_C] [W] [J_C]^T + \mu [J_M][J_M]^T + [W]}
\end{equation}

In the above equation $\mu$ represents the weighting of the motion correction. 
In this experiment the motion correction weighting was set to 100. 

Combining \fref{eq:regular_rm} and \fref{eq:motion_rm} a reconstruction
matrix to reconstruct exclusiveley the noise due to movement ($R_N$) 
in an image can be generated.

\begin{equation}
	R_N = R_M - R_C
\end{equation}

An image ($X$) is reconstructed using 
the measurements ($b$) and reconstruction matrix ($R$) as follows:

\begin{equation}
	X = bR
\end{equation}

Three images: $X_C$, $X_M$ and $X_N$ are recontstructed from their 
respective reconstruction matrix. 

A new movment correction strategy had been built 
around the reconstructed image $X_N$.
The noise due to exclusively motion is reconstructed into a 
3D image, and the center of mass of the positive change is located. 
This is assumed to be the direction of the motion. The amplitude of the electrode 
motion is estimated as half of the distance between the 
conductive object and the probe this method is illustrated in
\fref{fig:motion_correction_methods}. Images were reconstructed and displayed 
on a 64 by 64 grid to give a more accurate position of the 
electrode position between the model and the image.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter7-internal_elec_motion/imgs/recon_methods.pdf} 
   \caption[Motion correction methods]{\label{fig:motion_correction_methods} 
	Three image reconstruction matricies are generated: one to calculate an image based 
	only on the measurements (A), one that is able to reduce the impact of noise using a 
	movement jacobian (B) and finally a reconstruction that reconstructs only the noise 
	due to motion of the probe (C). The center of mass of the conductive object is used to
	estimate the probe location and direction of movement. The green arrow indicates the 
	the calculated direction of movement (multiplied by 5 for visibility).
	The black line indicates the outline of the region of conductivity at the imaged plane.
	The images depict an average of 10 slices between the external electrode planes.}
\end{figure}

Using the probe location estimate calculated from $X_N$
a new model was reconstructed with the probe repositioned 
to the reconstructed location. 
This model was then used to to calculate a new reconstruction matrix 
using \fref{eq:motion_rm}
with an updated jacobian based on the new probe location. 


\section{Image comparison}
To simplify processing of the reconstructions, 10 images between the 
external electrode planes were averaged together to generate a 2D 
representation of the 3D data. This dis not allow for analysis of movement in the vertical 
direction, but we did not expect this to be a major contribution in real-world data.
The reconstructed images were compared in 2 ways. First the accuracry of the resontruction
was evaluated by computing the Jaccard index between the actual and imaged boundaries of the 
conductive target. The imaged boundary was drawn at half the maximum value of the brightest 
object in the image. The second metric comupted was a noise estimate. This was calculated as
the amplitude of the imaged object relative to the amplitude of the entire image through the
following equation:

\begin{equation}
	N = 1-\frac{A_{\text{object}}}{A_{\text{image}}}
\end{equation}

Where $A_{\text{object}}$ is the amplitude of the object, $A_{\text{image}}$ is the amplitude 
of the image, and it is subtracted from 1 so that a noise estimate of 0 corresponds with 
all of the image signal corresponding to the conductive target.

\subsection{\emph{In-vivo} recordings}
Data were collected in 3 ewes during ventilation under 
general anesthetic using the SenTec EIT Pioneer Set.
A skip 4 measurement pattern was used with an injection current 
of 3 mA at 20 kHz. Electrodes 29 to 32 were connected to the intenal
electrode probe. 

\subsubsection{Internal electrode probe design}
The internal electrode probe consisted of 4 brass electrodes on a flexible tube. 
Each electrode was 1 cm in length and the spacing between electrodes was 2 cm. 
The electrodes were created from
a brass sheet with a thickness of 2 mm that was bent to the shape 
of the flexible flexible tubing and soldered to 
achieve a smooth surface. The electrodes were glued in place 
on the tube prodruding 2 mm from probe surface.
The constructed probe is shown in \fref{fig:probe_design}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, angle =-90]{chapter7-internal_elec_motion/imgs/probe_prototype.jpg} 
	\caption[Probe prototype]{\label{fig:probe_design}

	esophagea use. Edges of the electrodes are soldered and filed to be smooth. 
	The electrodes are glued in place and wires run down the hollow center
	of the tube to connect to the EIT system.}
 \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Ovine model}
An internal probe was added to an ovine model by adapting the 
\verb!mk_library_model!
function in EIDORS~\parencite{adler_eidors_2017}. A circular region was added to the
geomerty library that was extruded upwards to make a hole at the probe location. 
External electrodes were placed in a ``square'' pattern on the boundary, and internal
electrodes were added as cylindrical objects in the central hole of the model.
The resulting model is shown in \fref{fig:internal_lamb_model}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chapter7-internal_elec_motion/imgs/lamb_model.pdf} 
	\caption[Ovine model with internal probe]{\label{fig:internal_lamb_model} 
	An internal electrode was added to an ovine model by creating a hole at desired probe
	location and added cylindrical electrodes at the desired heights. External electrodes
	were placed in a ``square'' electrode configuration on the boundary. Electrodes 1 to 28 were 
	external and 29 to 32 were internal.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Reconstruction}
Images were reconstruted with 4 methods. The 3 methods discussed in \fref{sec:3_methods}, 
and GREIT~\parencite{grychtol_3d_2016}.

\subsubsection{Pulsatile amplitude}
To measure the advantage provided by internal electrodes with regards to pulsatility detection, 
a fast fourrier transform (\acrshort{fft}) of each signal was calculated. 
The cardiosynchronous component was selected as the highest 
the amplitude near the recorded heartrate range of 65-80 bpm.
This was divided by the amplitude of the ventilation frequency, which was the largest
low frequency amplitude in the FFT. 
This was repeated for all 12 recordings across 3 animals.

\section{Results}
The following section presents the results for both simulation and 
\emph{in-vivo} work.

\subsection{Simulation}
It was found that there was no measureable difference between 
simulations of models using spherical internal electrodes 
relative to the
cylindrical electrodes. The results are presented
using the cylindrical model to be consistent with the 
lamb models.
The probe was moved in in the $-\mathbf{y}$ direction for figures and calculations
in the reults.

\Fref{fig:probe_location_correction} shows the result of the 3 reconstruction methods. The boundaries 
of the reconstructed and actual targets are outlined to highlight the performance. 
The new method is able to reconstruct the correct location with motion of up to 10 \% 
of the tank boundary between measurements. The jaccard index and noise estimate for each method 
are presented below in \fref{tab:recon_accuracy_jaccard} and \fref{tab:recon_accuracy_noise}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption[Ovine model with internal probe]{\label{tab:recon_accuracy_jaccard} 
The jaccard indexes were calculated for each of the reconstructions in 
\fref{fig:probe_location_correction}. Method A does not use any motion correction.
Method B incorporates the movment jacobian, and method C uses the new probe location correction
technique. For jaccard index closer to 1 is better.}
\begin{tabular}{SSSS} \toprule
    {Movement (\% of radius)} & {Method A} & {Method B} & {Method C} \\ \midrule
    1  & 0.732 & 0.809 & 0.802 \\
    5  & 0.038 & 0.654 & 0.808 \\
    10 & 0.003 & 0.227 & 0.577 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For movement of 1 percent of the tank boundary motion correction using only the 
movement jacobian was roughly equivalent to the probe location correction algorithm.
Across all other scenarios the probe location correction  algorithm achieved a higher 
jaccard score.
Across all scenarios the new tecnique to correct for motion had the lowest 
noise estimate score.

	\centering
	\caption[Ovine model with internal probe]{\label{tab:recon_accuracy_noise}

	\fref{fig:probe_location_correction}. Method A does not use any motion correction.
	Method B incorporates the movment jacobian, and method C uses the new probe location correction
	technique. For the noise estimate a lower score is better, a score of 0 indicates all image changes
	occur within the target boundary, and a core less than 1 indicates most of the changes in the 
	image are due to the identified target.}
	\begin{tabular}{SSSS} \toprule
		{Movement (\% of radius)} & {Method A} & {Method B} & {Method C} \\ \midrule
		1  & 0.588 & 0.537 & 0.529 \\
		5  & 0.781 & 0.669 & 0.618 \\
		10 & 0.777 & 0.747 & 0.718 \\ \bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

	relative to the tank radius.

	column (B) shows the method using the movement jacobian, and 
	column (C) shows the results of the new probe location correction method.
	The green outline indicates the reconstructed boundary of the conductive target, 
	and the black outline is the actual boundary.}
\end{figure}

When looking at the reconstructions using the three methods, the new probe correction technique
reconstructed the target as the brightest object in all scenarios. With no motion correction the 
target was identified correctly only in the first scenario. Using the movement jacobaian 
reconsturciton method, the target was correctly identified when the probe was moved 1 or 5 percent
of the tank radius. 

\subsection{\emph{In-vivo}}
Recordings in each of the three ewes are presented in this section.
Reconstructions with internal electrodes are shown in
\fref{fig:internal_reconstructions}

\begin{figure}
    \centering

	for electrode location correction. Column (D) contains regonstructions using the GREIT 3D algorithm.
	The number of pixels is different between images due to the methodology of probe localization and 
	the limitations of GREIT.}
\end{figure}

Reconstructions with movement correction applied to the internal electrode appear to show a 
slight improvement in lung distinguishability and a slight reduction
in noise surrounding the internal electrode. There is limited difference between the
two methods accounting for motion on the electrode.

The ratio of cardiosynchronous to respiratory rate impedance signals is shown below in 
\fref{fig:amplitude_ratio}. The results show a mugh higher amplitude of the cardiopulmonary 
signal relative to ventilation when internal electrodes are used.

	componenent to compare the detectability of the pulsatile changes. The ratio was compared 
	for measuremnts using only external electrodes, all electrodes, and internal electrodes only.}
\end{figure}~

\section{Discussion}

This chapter aimed to provide a technique to reduce noise due to motion on internal
electrodes when reconstructing images in 3D and demonstrate the noise reduction technique
\emph{in-vivo}. The new technique to reconstruct images in the presence of motion 
on internal electrodes was able to reconstruct an image of a conductive target 
more accurately and with less noise in the surrounding image. \emph{In-vivo}
reconstructions showed a slight improvement in lung distinguishability when correcting
for motion artefact on internal electrodes compared to methods without this correction 
including GREIT. 

It was found that GREIT performed poorly when reconstructing data with internal electrodes.
The figures of merit for GREIT designed and optimized to work with external electrodes 
where sensitivity is low in the center of the model and high at the 
edges~\parencite{adler_greit_2009}. An adaptation to GREIT that is able to 
account for internal electrodes and motion of an internal probe is planned as a
continuation of this project.  

Two different types of internal electrodes were created in this chapter. One with
spherical internal electrodes and one with a hollow probe and cylindrical electrodes. 
Meshing and creating internal electrodes can be challenging due to limited meshing tools 
for using internal electrodes with EIT and the method of adding internal probes to
anatomical models using a hollow region in the center of the model was created for this 
project. Code to generate this model with internal electrodes is planed to be included in a
future release of EIDORS.

The noise estimate score calculations were not perfect representations of the noise
in the images due to the way the reconstructed object was identified.  Since the
brightest object was always identified as the object, the noise estimate was
artificially low in come cases. 
Comparing the amplitude of changes contained within the actual
object boundaries could be a better metric of the noise present in the image, but this
would also be dependant on the accuracy of reconstruction and would have favoured
the method that reconstructed the object most accurately.
The boundary of the actual target
also changes due to differences in element locations as the 
probe is moved, so the comparison would not be consistent across all probe movment
states. Despite this limitation, the noise estimate does help to quantify 
the amount of noise seen in the iamges for each technique. 
The new
method performed better than existing techniques with regards to the computed
noise metrics.

In cases of less than 1 percent error in probe location, there was very little 
difference between 
the two motion correction algorithms with regards to 
reconstruction accuracy of the object. Despite this there was still a slight reduction 
in background noise in the image. 

Despite the sucess of the probe correction algorithm with regards to location accuracy 
and noise reduction there are several limitations to its use. The most significant is 
the increased modelling time required. This method required an extra model, and inverse 
solution compared to the single step solutions. For simple models such as 
a tank the added time difference
is small, but for complex models this could increase reconstruction time drastically. 
When several frames are reconstructed each one requires a unique model 
with a modified probe location increasing the time required significantly. 
To reduce the overall time, correcting the probe location only when it is above 1
percent of the model width may be helpful. The benefits of 
the probe localization technique are 
not substantial at this level of movement to be required. 
Additionally in the images presented and recorded there was not seen to be significant
probe movement. It is not yet clear what the typical movement of the electrode probe 
is expected to be in the esophagus. 

Previous studies with internal electrodes showed that there were also
cases where contact impedance of the probe was not ideal for electrodes
placed on the breathing and feeding tubes~\parencite{czaplik_application_2014}.
The electrode used was shown to have good contact impedance on the SenTec Pioneer
Set interface, but the current design protrudes slightly from the tube and may be challenging to 
integrate into a clinical esophageal or tracheal tube.
