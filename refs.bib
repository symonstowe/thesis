There has been little investigation of internal electrodes, however an internal electrode position promises to increase sensitivity in the most central regions of the chest to improve impedance imaging of the inner regions of the lung and heart. This paper investigates {EIT} sensitivity in simulation with various internal electrode positions.

We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its use. One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing algorithms and the consequent ease with which subtle numerical bugs can be inadvertently introduced. {EIDORS} helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and reuse of well-documented and debugged software. On the other hand, since {EIDORS} is designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, its use may inadvertently result in such numerical errors. In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as ‘cheats’) may occur.

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is a low-cost, noninvasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung. Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of {EIT} is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct {EIT} images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular {EIT} reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four {EIT} reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.},

The electrode segmentation scheme is then introduced as a feasible configuration offering efficient and improved resolution impedance imaging. Finally, the regularized total least squares algorithm is implemented to provide the linear step solution within Newton’s iterative scheme. Images of several reconstructed inhomogeneities are presented, using simulated measurements obtained from the segmented electrodes system.},

	abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography ({EIT}) reconstructs images of electrical tissue properties within a body from electrical transfer impedance measurements at surface electrodes. Reconstruction of {EIT} images requires the solution of an inverse problem in soft ﬁeld tomography, where a sensitivity matrix, J, of the relationship between internal changes and measurements is calculated, and then a pseudo-inverse of J is used to update the image estimate. It is therefore clear that a precise calculation of J is required for solution accuracy. Since it is generally not possible to use analytic solutions, the ﬁnite element method ({FEM}) is typically used. It has generally been recommended in the {EIT} literature that {FEMs} be reﬁned near electrodes, since the electric ﬁeld and sensitivity is largest there. In this paper we analyze the accuracy requirement for {FEM} reﬁnement near electrodes in {EIT} and describe a technique to reﬁne arbitrary {FEMs}.},

One key challenge for {EIT} in this application is the movement of electrodes during breathing, which introduces artefacts in reconstructed images. Various approaches have been proposed to compensate for electrode movement, but no comparison of these approaches is available. This paper analyses boundary model mismatch and electrode movement in lung {EIT}. The aim is to evaluate the extent to which various algorithms tolerate movement, and to determine if a patient specific model is required for {EIT} lung imaging. Movement data are simulated from a {CT}-based model, and image analysis is performed using quantitative figures of merit. The electrode movement is modelled based on expected values of chest movement and an extended Jacobian method is proposed to make use of exterior boundary tracking. Results show that a dynamical boundary tracking is the most robust method against any movement, but is computationally more expensive. Simultaneous electrode movement and conductivity reconstruction algorithms show increased robustness compared to only conductivity reconstruction. The results of this comparative study can help develop a better understanding of the impact of shape model mismatch and electrode movement in lung {EIT}.},

However, other factors such as heart motion can significantly affect this ventricular impedance change. In the present case study, a magnetic resonance imaging-based dynamic bio-impedance model fitting the morphology of a single male subject was built. Simulations were performed to evaluate the contribution of heart motion and its influence on {EIT}-based {SV} estimation. Myocardial deformation was found to be the main contributor to the ventricular impedance change (56\%). However, motion-induced impedance changes showed a strong correlation (r = 0.978) with left ventricular volume. We explained this by the quasi-incompressibility of blood and myocardium. As a result, {EIT} achieved excellent accuracy in estimating a wide range of simulated {SV} values (error distribution of 0.57 ± 2.19 ml (1.02 ± 2.62\%) and correlation of r = 0.996 after a two-point calibration was applied to convert impedance values to millilitres). As the model was based on one single subject, the strong correlation found between motion-induced changes and ventricular volume remains to be verified in larger datasets.},

The authors report on the results of an analysis of the expected improvement in distinguishability of target inhomogeneities when an esophageal reference electrode is located on the target-body interface. One-dimensional (1-D), two-dimensional (2-D) circular, and three-dimensional (3-D) spherical models were utilized for the evaluation. The results indicate an increase in the absolute value of the maximum difference between the voltages recorded with an insulating target present and no target present of a factor of two for the 1-D case and a factor of from two to more than ten for the 2-D and 3-D cases. The large enhancements for the 2-D and 3-D cases with small-diameter targets may indicate that the esophageal reference electrode acts as a focusing mechanism.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This paper systematically compares filtering-based perfusion estimates and bolus injection methods to determine to which degree they are related. Approach: {EIT} data was recorded on seven mechanically ventilated newborn lambs in which ventilation distribution was varied through changes in posture between prone, supine, left- and right-lateral positions. Perfusion images were calculated using frequency filtering and ensemble averaging during both ventilation and apnoea time segments for each posture to compare against contrast agent-based methods using Jaccard distance score. Main results: Using bolus-based {EIT} measures of lung perfusion as the reference frequency filtering techniques performed better than ensemble averaging and both techniques performed equally well across apnoea and ventilation data segments. Significance: Our results indicate the potential for use of filtering-based {EIT} measures of heart-frequency activity as a non-invasive proxy for contrast agent injection-based measures of lung perfusion.},

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography is clinically used to trace ventilation related changes in electrical conductivity of lung tissue. Estimating regional pulmonary perfusion using electrical impedance tomography is still a matter of research. To support clinical decision making, reliable bedside information of pulmonary perfusion is needed. We introduce a method to robustly detect pulmonary perfusion based on indicator-enhanced electrical impedance tomography and validate it by dynamic multidetector computed tomography in two experimental models of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The acute injury was induced in a sublobar segment of the right lung by saline lavage or endotoxin instillation in eight anesthetized mechanically ventilated pigs. For electrical impedance tomography measurements, a conductive bolus (10\% saline solution) was injected into the right ventricle during breath hold. Electrical impedance tomography perfusion images were reconstructed by linear and normalized Gauss-Newton reconstruction on a finite element mesh with subsequent element-wise signal and feature analysis. An iodinated contrast agent was used to compute pulmonary blood flow via dynamic multidetector computed tomography. Spatial perfusion was estimated based on first-pass indicator dilution for both electrical impedance and multidetector computed tomography and compared by Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Strong correlation was found in dorsoventral (r = 0.92) and in right-to-left directions (r = 0.85) with good limits of agreement of 8.74\% in eight lung segments. With a robust electrical impedance tomography perfusion estimation method, we found strong agreement between multidetector computed and electrical impedance tomography perfusion in healthy and regionally injured lungs and demonstrated feasibility of electrical impedance tomography perfusion imaging.},

	abstract = {Study Objectives: (1) To investigate changes in arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximeter ({SpO}2) during apnea and after reinstitution of manual ventilation at {SpO}2 of 95\% or 90\% following rapid sequence induction of anesthesia in children after 2-minute preoxygenation; (2) to determine whether the setting of a safe threshold of apneic period to an {SpO}2 of 95\% is appropriate in children during anesthetic induction; and (3) to evaluate the influences of age, body weight, and height on the time from the start of apnea to {SpO}2 of 95\%.Design: A clinical study of random design and comparison among groups.Setting: Operating room of a plastic surgery hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.Patients: 152 infants and children, {ASA} physical status I, aged 3 months to 12 years, scheduled for elective plastic surgery.Interventions: Patients were divided into three age groups: Group 1-infants 3 months to 1 year (n = 39); Group 2-children 1 to 3 years (n = 41); and Group 3-children 3 to 12 years (n = 72). Patients in each age group were randomly allocated again to Subgroups A and B. After a 2-minute preoxygenation, anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg, fentanyl 5 μg/kg, and suxamethonium 1.5 mg/kg. Patients were manually ventilated when {SpO}2 decreased to 90\% in Subgroups A and 95\% in Subgroups B, respectively, during apnea.Measurements and Main Results: {SpO}2 was measured continuously with a Datex pulse oximeter applied to the right index finger. During apnea, the times for {SpO}2 to decrease to 99\% (T99) and 95\% (T95) in all children, and 90\% (T90) in Subgroups A were recorded. The time for {SpO}2 to decrease from 95\% to 90\% (T95−90) in Subgroups A was also measured. After reinstitution of manual ventilation, the time when {SpO}2 continued to decrease (T1) and the time from the end of apnea to recovery of {SpO}2 baseline (T2) were determined. In addition, the lowest value of {SpO}2 after apnea was also recorded. The results showed that younger children were more susceptible than older children to the risk of hypoxemia during apnea. There were significant differences in T99, T95, T90, and T95−90 between the three age groups. T1 and T2 were significantly longer in Group 3 than in Groups 1 and 2. There were significant differences in the lowest values of {SpO}2 following apnea among the three Subgroups A and between Subgroups A and B of each age group. During apnea, heart rate decreased gradually as {SpO}2 decreased, showing a significant decrease at {SpO}2 of 95\%. Bradycardia was found in three children in Subgroups A. The apnea time to {SpO}2 of 95\% correlated well with age, weight, and height by linear regression analysis.Conclusions: The safe threshold of an apneic period setting to an {SpO}2 of 95\% was appropriate in children during anesthesia induction. Despite the same duration of preoxygenation, younger children were more susceptible than older ones to the risk of hypoxemia during apnea. The apnea time to {SpO}2 of 95\% correlated with age, body weight, and height using linear regression analysis.},

In the state of the art a new family of techniques providing {BP} surrogates based on the measurement of the so-called pulse wave velocity ({PWV}) has been proposed, eliminating the need for inflation cuffs. {PWV} is defined as the velocity at which pressure pulses propagate along the arterial wall. However, no technique to assess {PWV} within central arteries in a fully unsupervised manner has been proposed so far. In this pilot study, we provide first experimental evidence that electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is capable of measuring pressure pulses directly within the descending aorta. To obtain a wide range of {BP} values, we administrated noradrenalin and nitroglycerine to an anesthetized pig under mechanical ventilation. An arterial line was inserted into the ascending aorta for measuring reference {BP}. {EIT} images were generated from 32 impedance electrodes placed around the chest at the level of the axilla. Regions of Interest ({ROI}) such as the descending aorta and the lungs were automatically identified by a novel time-based processing algorithm as the respective {EIT} pixels representing these structures. The correct positions of these {ROIs} were confirmed by bolus injections of highly conductive concentrated saline into the right heart and into the ascending aorta. Aortic pulse transit time ({PTT}) values were determined as the delay between the opening of the aortic valve (obtained from arterial line) and the arrival of pressure pulses at the aortic {ROI} within the {EIT} plane. For 11 experimental conditions, with mean {BP} ranging from 73 to 141 {mmHg}, strongly significant correlation (r = -0.97, P {\textless} 0.00001) between central {BP} and aortic {PTT} was observed, suggesting that {EIT}-derived aortic {PTT} is a potential non-invasive surrogate of central {BP}.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

	abstract = {Background
Filling the lung with dense liquid perfluorocarbons during total liquid ventilation ({TLV}) might compress the myocardium, a plausible explanation for the instability occasionally reported with this technique. Our objective is to assess the impacts of {TLV} on the cardiovascular system, particularly left ventricular diastolic function, in an ovine model of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.
Method
Eight newborns lambs, 3.0 ± 0.4 days (3.2 ± 0.3kg) were used in this crossover experimental study. Animals were intubated, anesthetized and paralyzed. Catheters were inserted in the femoral and pulmonary arteries. A high-fidelity pressure catheter was inserted into the left ventricle. Surfactant deficiency was induced by repeated lung lavages with normal saline. {TLV} was then conducted for 2 hours using a liquid ventilator prototype. Thoracic echocardiography and cardiac output assessment by thermodilution were performed before and during {TLV}.
Results
Left ventricular end diastolic pressure ({LVEDP}) (9.3 ± 2.1 vs. 9.2 ± 2.4mmHg, p = 0.89) and dimension (1.90 ± 0.09 vs. 1.86 ± 0.12cm, p = 0.72), negative {dP}/dt (-2589 ± 691 vs. -3115 ± 866mmHg/s, p = 0.50) and cardiac output (436 ± 28 vs. 481 ± 59ml/kg/min, p = 0.26) were not affected by {TLV} initiation. Left ventricular relaxation time constant (tau) slightly increased from 21.5 ± 3.3 to 24.9 ± 3.7ms (p = 0.03). Mean arterial systemic (48 ± 6 vs. 53 ± 7mmHg, p = 0.38) and pulmonary pressures (31.3 ± 2.5 vs. 30.4 ± 2.3mmHg, p = 0.61) were stable. As expected, the inspiratory phase of liquid cycling exhibited a small but significant effect on most variables (i.e. central venous pressure +2.6 ± 0.5mmHg, p = 0.001; {LVEDP} +1.18 ± 0.12mmHg, p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions
{TLV} was well tolerated in our neonatal lamb model of severe respiratory distress syndrome and had limited impact on left ventricle diastolic function when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation.},

It is shown that the sensitivity of {EIT} to tissue resistivity variations due to blood perfusion is good enough to image blood flow to the lungs; hence, abnormalities in pulmonary perfusion, such as pulmonary embolism, should appear in {EIT} images. In addition, more valuable information related to the cardiac activity can be gained from {EIT} images than from impedance cardiography.

The aim of our study was to assess the reproducibility of regional lung ventilation distribution determined by {EIT} during mechanical ventilation under identical ventilator settings. The experiments were performed on 10 anaesthetized supine pigs ventilated in a volume-controlled mode. {EIT} measurements were performed with the Goe-{MF} {II} device (Viasys Healthcare, Höchberg, Germany) during repeated changes in positive end-expiratory pressure ({PEEP}) from 0 to 10 cm H2O. Regional lung ventilation was determined in the right and left hemithorax as well as in 64 regions of interest evenly distributed over each chest side in the ventrodorsal direction. Ventilation distributions in both lungs were visualized as ventrodorsal ventilation profiles and shifts in ventilation distribution quantified in terms of centres of ventilation in relation to the chest diameter. The proportion of the right lung on total ventilation in the chest cross-section was 0.54 ± 0.04 and remained unaffected by repetitive {PEEP} changes. Initial {PEEP} increase resulted in a redistribution of ventilation towards dorsal lung regions with a shift of the centre of ventilation from 45 ± 3\% to 49 ± 3\% of the chest diameter in the right and from 47 ± 2\% to 50 ± 2\% in the left hemithorax. Excellent reproducibility of the results in the individual regions of interest with almost identical patterns of ventilation distribution was found during repeated {PEEP} changes.},

	abstract = {A study was conducted using the Sheffield electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) portable system {DAS}-01 P to determine the change in the cardiac image with electrode position, lung volume and body position. Sixteen electrodes were positioned in three transverse planes around the thorax at the level of the second intercostal space, at the level of the xiphisternal joint, and midway between upper and lower locations. Data were collected at each electrode level with the breath held at end expiration and after inspiring 0.5, 1 and 1.5 l of air with the subject in both the supine and sitting position. These data were analysed using a Matlab developed program that calculates the average resistivity change in the cardiac region from automatically determined borders. Results show significant individual variability with electrode position and air volume. The middle electrode most consistently shows an increase in impedance in the region of the heart during systole. In some subjects the change in the ventricular-volume-like curve showed a greater than 50\% change as a function of lung volume. The pattern of variability with electrode position was not consistent among subjects. In one subject {MRI} images were obtained to compare actual structures with those seen in the {EIT} image. The results suggest that using these electrode locations reliable and consistent data, which could be used in clinical applications, cannot be obtained.},

	abstract = {{ECG}-gated electrical impedance tomographic spectroscopy ({EITS}) measurements of the lungs were taken on seven normal subjects in the frequency range 9.6 {kHz} to 614.4 {kHz}. The results show that in late systole the resistivity relative to the R-wave (i.e. at the R-wave) decreases consistently within the lung. In addition there arises an increase in in early systole towards the periphery of the lung. Frequency behaviour of changes with location. At all times after the R-wave, in the centre of the lung is higher at higher frequency f whereas in the periphery it is lower at higher f. The principal decrease in can be explained by increasing pulmonary blood volume due to cardiac contraction. The early systolic increase is presumably due to venous return to the left atrium locally leading blood output from the right ventricle which is delayed by the windkessel effect. Based on a model taking extracapillary and capillary blood volume increase into account, the change in frequency behaviour of is explained by regional variations in extracapillary blood vessel size determining the relative contributions of extracapillary blood volume change and capillary blood volume change to at a certain frequency.},

Building on these successful studies, we studied contrast {EIT} for pulmonary perfusion defect caused by an artificially induced pulmonary embolism ({PE}) in a large ovine model (N = 8, 78 ± 7.8 kg). Furthermore, the efficacy of a less invasive contrast bolus of 0.77 ml kg−1 of {NaCl} 3\% was compared with a more concentrated bolus of 0.13 ml kg−1 of {NaCl} 20\%. Prior to the injection of each contrast bolus injection, ventilation was turned off to provide a total of 40 to 45 s of apnoea. Each bolus of impedance contrast was injected through a catheter into the right atrium. Pulmonary embolisation was performed by balloon occlusion of part of the right branch of the pulmonary trunk. Four parameters representing the kinetics of the contrast dilution in the lung were evaluated for statistical differences between baseline and {PE}, including peak value, maximum uptake, maximum washout and area under the curve of the averaged contrast dilution curve in each lung. Furthermore, the right lung to left lung (R2L) ratio of each the aforementioned parameters were assessed. While all of the R2L ratios yielded significantly different means between baseline and {PE}, it can be concluded that the R2L ratios of area under the curve and peak value of the averaged contrast dilution curve are the most promising and reliable in assessing {PE}. It was also found that the efficacy of the two types of impedance contrasts were not significantly different in distinguishing {PE} from baseline in our model.},

Our goal was to test the diagnostic accuracy of an automated quantification of combined upright and supine myocardial {SPECT} for detection of coronary artery disease ({CAD}) (≥70\% luminal diameter stenosis or, in left main coronary artery, ≥50\% luminal diameter stenosis) in comparison to invasive coronary angiography ({ICA}). Methods: We studied 142 patients undergoing upright and supine {HS}-{SPECT}, including 56 consecutive patients (63\% men; mean age ± {SD}, 64 ± 13 y; 45\% exercise stress) without known {CAD} who underwent diagnostic {ICA} within 6 mo of {HS}-{SPECT} and 86 consecutive patients with a low likelihood of {CAD}. Reference limits for upright and supine {HS}-{SPECT} were created from studies of patients with a low likelihood of {CAD}. Automated software adopted from supine-prone analysis was used to quantify the severity and extent of perfusion abnormality and was expressed as total perfusion deficit ({TPD}). {TPD} was obtained for upright (U-{TPD}), supine (S-{TPD}), and combined upright-supine acquisitions (C-{TPD}). Stress U-{TPD} ≥ 5\%, S-{TPD} ≥ 5\%, and C-{TPD} ≥ 3\% myocardium were considered abnormal for per-patient analysis, and U-{TPD}, S-{TPD}, and C-{TPD} ≥ 2\% in each coronary artery territory were considered abnormal for per-vessel analysis. Results: On a per-patient basis, the sensitivity was 91\%, 88\%, and 94\% for U-{TPD}, S-{TPD}, and C-{TPD}, respectively, and specificity was 59\%, 73\%, and 86\% for U-{TPD}, S-{TPD}, and C-{TPD}, respectively. C-{TPD} had a larger area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve than U-{TPD} or S-{TPD} for identification of stenosis ≥ 70\% (0.94 vs. 0.88 and 0.89, P {\textless} 0.05 and not significant, respectively). On a per-vessel basis, the sensitivity was 67\%, 66\%, and 69\% for U-{TPD}, S-{TPD}, and C-{TPD}, respectively, and specificity was 91\%, 94\%, and 97\% for U-{TPD}, S-{TPD}, and C-{TPD}, respectively (P = 0.02 for specificity U-{TPD} vs. C-{TPD}). Conclusion: In this first comparison of {HS}-{SPECT} with {ICA}, new automated quantification of combined upright and supine {HS}-{SPECT} shows high diagnostic accuracy for detecting clinically significant {CAD}, with findings comparable to those reported using conventional {SPECT}.

	abstract = {Abstract Introduction The use of alveolar recruitment maneuvers during general anaesthesia of horses is a potentially useful therapeutic option for the ventilatory management. While the routine application of recruitments would benefit from the availability of dedicated large animal ventilators their impact on ventilation and perfusion in the horse is not yet well documented nor completely understood. Case history A healthy 533 kg experimental horse underwent general anaesthesia in lateral recumbency. During intermittent positive pressure ventilation a stepwise alveolar recruitment maneuver was performed. Management Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen using a large animal circle system. Mechanical ventilation was applied in pressure ventilation mode and an alveolar recruitment maneuver performed employing a sequence of ascending and descending positive end expiratory pressures. Next to the standard monitoring, which included spirometry, additionally three non-invasive monitoring techniques were used: electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}), volumetric capnography and respiratory ultrasonic plethysmography. The functional images continuously delivered by {EIT} initially showed markedly reduced ventilation in the dependent lung and allowed on-line monitoring of the dynamic changes in the distribution of ventilation during the recruitment maneuver. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of compliance, dead space fraction, tidal volumes and changes in end expiratory lung volume were possible without technical difficulties. Follow up The horse made an unremarkable recovery. Conclusion The novel non-invasive monitoring technologies used in this study provided unprecedented insights into the physiology of lung collapse and recruitment. The synergic information of these techniques holds promise to be useful when developing and evaluating new ventilatory strategies in horses.},

The electrical conductivity of certain tissue regions within the forearm change as blood vessels undergo pulsatile dilation in synchrony with the beating of the heart. We use dynamic electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) gated to the peak of a pulse oxymetry plethysmography waveform to image this temporally varying spatial conductivity. A phantom imaging experiment is presented showing that small conductivity changes of less than 1 mm are detectable using the developed dynamic {EIT} system. This system is used to image a volunteer's forearm during resting cardiovascular activity. Similar structures are observed in the plethysmography trace and the temporally varying conductivity. Spectral analysis shows that the maximum amplitude is occurring at frequencies of 1.19 Hz and 1.21 Hz for the plethysmography trace and conductivity trace, respectively. This preliminary data suggests that {EIT} may be sensitive enough to visualize cardiac-based pulsatility in the peripheral vessels of the forearm.},

However, interpretation of {EIT} images is made difficult by the large region above and below the electrode plane to which {EIT} is sensitive. Volumetric {EIT} images using two (or more) electrode planes should help compensate, but are little used currently. The Graz consensus reconstruction algorithm for {EIT} ({GREIT}) has become popular in lung {EIT}. One shortcoming of the original formulation of {GREIT} is its restriction to reconstruction onto a 2D planar image. We present an extension of the {GREIT} algorithm to 3D and develop open-source tools to evaluate its performance as a function of the choice of stimulation and measurement pattern. Results show 3D {GREIT} using two electrode layers has significantly more uniform sensitivity profiles through the chest region. Overall, the advantages of 3D {EIT} are compelling.},

Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) can detect changes in impedance caused by pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, but the effect of changes in the position of the body and in the placing of the electrode belt on the impedance signal have not to our knowledge been thoroughly evaluated. We therefore studied ventilation-related and perfusion-related changes in impedance during spontaneous breathing in 10 healthy subjects in five different body positions and with the electrode belt placed at three different thoracic positions using a 32-electrode {EIT} system. We found differences between regions of interest that could be attributed to changes in the position of the body, and differences in impedance amplitudes when the position of the electrode belt was changed. Ventilation-related changes in impedance could therefore be related to changes in the position of both the body and the electrode belt. Perfusion-related changes in impedance were probably related to the interference of major vessels. While these findings give us some insight into the sources of variation in impedance signals as a result of changes in the positions of both the body and the electrode belt, further studies on the origin of the perfusion-related impedance signal are needed to improve {EIT} further as a tool for the monitoring of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion.},

	abstract = {Cardiac output ({CO}) and stroke volume ({SV}) are parameters of key clinical interest. Many techniques exist to measure {CO} and {SV}, but are either invasive or insufficiently accurate in clinical settings. Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) has been suggested as a noninvasive measure of {SV}, but inconsistent results have been reported. Our goal is to determine the accuracy and reliability of {EIT}-based {SV} measurements, and whether advanced image reconstruction approaches can help to improve the estimates. Data were collected on ten healthy volunteers undergoing postural changes and exercise. To overcome the sensitivity to heart displacement and thorax morphology reported in previous work, we used a 3D {EIT} configuration with 2 planes of 16 electrodes and subject-specific reconstruction models. Various {EIT}-derived {SV} estimates were compared to reference measurements derived from the oxygen uptake. Results revealed a dramatic impact of posture on the {EIT} images. Therefore, the analysis was restricted to measurements in supine position under controlled conditions (low noise and stable heart and lung regions). In these measurements, amplitudes of impedance changes in the heart and lung regions could successfully be derived from {EIT} using {ECG} gating. However, despite a subject-specific calibration the heart-related estimates showed an error of 0.0 ± 15.2 {mL} for absolute {SV} estimation. For trending of relative {SV} changes, a concordance rate of 80.9\% and an angular error of −1.0 ± 23.0° were obtained. These performances are insufficient for most clinical uses. Similar conclusions were derived from lung-related estimates. Our findings indicate that the key difficulty in {EIT}-based {SV} monitoring is that purely amplitude-based features are strongly influenced by other factors (such as posture, electrode contact impedance and lung or heart conductivity). All the data of the present study are made publicly available for further investigations.},

In children, however, the distribution of ventilation in response to gravity is the reverse of that seen in adults. The aim of the current study was to determine whether perfusion showed the same reversal in children or followed the adult pattern. Distribution of perfusion was measured with intravenous technetium-99m macroaggregated albumin and distribution of ventilation with inhaled krypton-81m. Eighteen children and seven adults were studied; they had been referred for lung scanning for various respiratory problems. The effect of gravity was examined by giving aliquots of macroaggregated albumin and 81mKr by inhalation to the subject in the supine and the lateral decubitus position. Counts in the dependent lung were compared with those in the upper lung. The dependent lung in the lateral decubitus position received more of the total perfusion than it did in the supine position in seven children with a normal chest radiograph (mean 7.0\%, range 4.8-10.9\% more) and in 11 children with an abnormal radiograph (mean 3.4\%(0.1-10.0\%)). Ventilation, however, changed in the opposite direction, falling by 7.1\% (-3.2\% to -12.8\%) in five children with a normal chest radiograph and 11.2\% (-2.8\% to -19.3\%) in eight children with an abnormal radiograph. Fractional V/fractional Q (an index of the ventilation:perfusion ratio) decreased in the dependent lung in the children when they moved from the supine to the decubitus position. The same directional change was recorded in adults, but it was significantly less than in the children, irrespective of whether the chest radiograph was abnormal. In children and adults with various respiratory problems the effect of posture on the distribution of perfusion is similar.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the case of imaging of the thorax the parameters available relate to cardiac activity and pulmonary perfusion. Imaging the relatively small changes in the resistivity of the lungs due to pulmonary perfusion in the presence of noise and the larger ventilation component is difficult. Suggested solutions involve multiple time averaging of cardiac gated data or reconstructed images. The required number of data frames for this type of processing is large (at least 100 cardiac cycles). Because the ventilation and perfusion components of the resistivity signals are well separated in the frequmcy domain, they can be differentiated by filtering.

The past decade has seen clinical application and commercial activity using {EIT} for ventilation monitoring.

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is an attractive method for clinically monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation, because it can provide a non-invasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance which indicates the distribution of ventilation. However, most clinical and physiological research in lung {EIT} is done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is an obstacle to interpretation of {EIT} images because the reconstructed images are not well characterized. To address this issue, we develop a consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung {EIT}, called {GREIT} (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for {EIT}). This paper describes the unified approach to linear image reconstruction developed for {GREIT}. The framework for the linear reconstruction algorithm consists of (1) detailed finite element models of a representative adult and neonatal thorax, (2) consensus on the performance figures of merit for {EIT} image reconstruction and (3) a systematic approach to optimize a linear reconstruction matrix to desired performance measures. Consensus figures of merit, in order of importance, are (a) uniform amplitude response, (b) small and uniform position error, (c) small ringing artefacts, (d) uniform resolution, (e) limited shape deformation and (f) high resolution. Such figures of merit must be attained while maintaining small noise amplification and small sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement. This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative group of experts in {EIT} algorithm design and clinical applications for pulmonary monitoring. All software and data to implement and test the algorithm have been made available under an open source license which allows free research and commercial use.},

In this paper, we review the current state and future prospects for lung {EIT}, by a synthesis of the presentations of the authors at the ‘special lung sessions’ of the annual biomedical {EIT} conferences in 2009–2011. We argue that lung {EIT} research has arrived at an important transition. It is now clear that valid and reproducible physiological information is available from {EIT} lung images. We must now ask the question: How can these data be used to help improve patient outcomes? To answer this question, we develop a classification of possible clinical scenarios in which {EIT} could play an important role, and we identify clinical and experimental research programmes and engineering developments required to turn {EIT} into a clinically useful tool for lung monitoring.},

	abstract = {In spontaneously breathing or ventilated subjects, it is difficult to image cardiac-related conductivity changes using electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) due to the high amplitude of the ventilation component. Previous attempts to separate these components included either electrocardiogram-gated averaging, frequency domain filtering or holding the breath while performing the measurements. However, such methods are either not able to produce continuous real-time images or to fully separate cardiac and pulmonary changes. The aim of this work was to develop a new dynamic filtering method for the online separation of pulmonary and cardiac changes avoiding the drawbacks of the previous attempts. The approach is based on estimating template functions for the pulmonary and cardiac components by means of principal component analysis and frequency domain filtering. Then, these templates are fitted into the input signals. The new method enables an observer to examine the variation of the cardiac signal beat-by-beat after a one-time setup period of 20 s. Preliminary in vivo results of two healthy subjects are presented. The results are superior to frequency domain filtering and in good agreement with signals averaged over several cardiac cycles. The method does not depend on {ECG} or other a priori knowledge. The apparent validity of the method's ability to separate cardiac and pulmonary changes in {EIT} images was shown and has to be confirmed in future studies. The algorithm opens up new possibilities for future clinical trials on continuous monitoring by means of {EIT} and for the examination of the relation between the cardiac component and lung perfusion.},

In a pilot experiment, we address this problem by comparing a number of different Impedance Contrast Boluses ({ICBs}). Conductivity changes in the lungs of a sheep after the injection of four different {ICBs} were compared, including three {NaCl}-based {ICBs} and one glucose-based {ICB}. The following procedure was followed for each {ICB}. Firstly, ventilation was turned off to provide an apneic window of approximately 40s to image the conductivity changes due to the {ICB}. Each {ICB} was then injected through a pig-tail catheter directly into the right atrium. {EIT} images were acquired throughout the apnea to capture the conductivity change. For each {ICB}, the experiment was repeated three times. The three {NaCl}-based {ICB} exhibited similar behaviour in which following the injection of each of these {ICBs}, the conductivity of each lung predictably increased. The effect of the {ICB} of 5\% glucose solution was inconclusive. A small decrease in conductivity in the left lung was observed in two out of three cases and none was discernible in the right lung.},

In anticipation of more research on this subject, we believe a thorough review is called for. In this paper, findings related to the physiological origins and electrical characteristics of this signal are summarized, highlighting properties that are particularly relevant to {EIT}. The perfusion impedance change signal is significantly smaller in amplitude compared with the changes due to ventilation. Therefore, the hardware used for this purpose must be more sensitive and more resilient to noise. In previous works, some signal- or image-processing methods have been required to separate these two signals. Three different techniques are reviewed in this paper, including the {ECG}-gating method, frequency-domain-filtering-based methods and a principal-component-analysis-based method. In addition, we review a number of experimental studies on both human and animal subjects that employed {EIT} for perfusion imaging, with promising results in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ({PE}) and pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as other potential applications. In our opinion, {PE} is most likely to become the main focus for perfusion {EIT} in the future, especially for heavily instrumented patients in the intensive care unit ({ICU}).},

Ideally, assessment of lung perfusion should be performed in real-time with an imaging technology that provides, through fast acquisition of sequential images, information about the regional dynamics or regional kinetics of an appropriate tracer. We present a novel electrical impedance tomography ({EIT})-based method that quantitatively estimates regional lung perfusion based on first-pass kinetics of a bolus of hypertonic saline contrast. Pulmonary blood flow was measured in six piglets during control and unilateral or bilateral lung collapse conditions. The first-pass kinetics method showed good agreement with the estimates obtained by single-photon-emission computerized tomography ({SPECT}). The mean difference ({SPECT} minus {EIT}) between fractional blood flow to lung areas suffering atelectasis was −0.6\%, with a {SD} of 2.9\%. This method outperformed the estimates of lung perfusion based on impedance pulsatility. In conclusion, we describe a novel method based on {EIT} for estimating regional lung perfusion at the bedside. In both healthy and injured lung conditions, the distribution of pulmonary blood flow as assessed by {EIT} agreed well with the one obtained by {SPECT}. The method proposed in this study has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of regional perfusion under different lung and therapeutic conditions.},

The Sheffield Mk2 system was used to obtain the {EIT} images during quiet tidal breathing and the images were then analysed to extract the cardiac and respiratory related components. In the 10 normal subjects the mean measured change in resistivity during tidal breathing was 9\% ({SD} 3\%) with no significant difference in four lung regions. The mean changes during the cardiac cycle were different in the four regions, ranging from -0.9\% to -2.6\%. The two patients showed very different cardiac related changes from those found in the normals in the posterior lung regions. The sign of the changes was positive, whereas it was negative in the normals. The changes in the anterior lung regions were within the range found in the authors' normal group.},

A novel approach for the noninvasive and unsupervised monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure ({PAP}) in patients with {PH} was proposed and investigated. The approach was based on the use of electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}), a noninvasive and safe monitoring technique, and was tested through simulations on a realistic 4D bio-impedance model of the human thorax. Changes in {PAP} were induced in the model by simulating multiple types of hypertensive conditions. A timing parameter physiologically linked to the {PAP} via the so-called pulse wave velocity principle was automatically estimated from the {EIT} data. It was found that changes in {PAP} could indeed be reliably monitored by {EIT}, irrespective of the pathophysiological condition that caused them. If confirmed clinically, these findings could open the way for a new generation of noninvasive {PAP} monitoring solutions for the follow-up of patients with {PH}.},

Current options for measuring {PAP} are limited in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate if electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}), a radiation-free and non-invasive monitoring technique, can be used for the continuous, unsupervised and safe monitoring of {PAP}. In 30 healthy volunteers we induced gradual increases in systolic {PAP} ({SPAP}) by exposure to normobaric hypoxemia. At various stages of the protocol, the {SPAP} of the subjects was estimated by transthoracic echocardiography. In parallel, in the pulmonary vasculature, pulse wave velocity was estimated by {EIT} and calibrated to pressure units. Within-cohort agreement between both methods on {SPAP} estimation was assessed through Bland–Altman analysis and at subject level, with Pearson’s correlation coefficient. There was good agreement between the two methods (inter-method difference not significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05), bias ± standard deviation of − 0.1 ± 4.5 {mmHg}) independently of the degree of {PAP}, from baseline oxygen saturation levels to profound hypoxemia. At subject level, the median per-subject agreement was 0.7 ± 3.8 {mmHg} and Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0.87 (P {\textless} 0.05). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of accurately assessing changes in {SPAP} by {EIT} in healthy volunteers. If confirmed in a patient population, the non-invasive and unsupervised day-to-day monitoring of {SPAP} could facilitate the clinical management of patients with pulmonary hypertension.},

	abstract = {Objective: Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) shows potential for radiation-free and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring. However, many factors degrade the accuracy and repeatability of these measurements. Our goal is to estimate the impact of this variability on the {EIT}-based monitoring of two important central hemodynamic parameters: stroke volume ({SV}) and pulmonary artery pressure ({PAP}). Approach: We performed simulations on a 4D () bioimpedance model of a human volunteer to study the influence of four potential confounding factors (electrode belt displacement, electrode detachment, changes in hematocrit and lung air volume) on the performance of {EIT}-based {SV} and {PAP} estimation. Results were used to estimate how these factors affect the {EIT} measures of either absolute values or relative changes (i.e. trending). Main results: Our findings reveal that the absolute measurement of {SV} via {EIT} is very sensitive to electrode belt displacements and lung conductivity changes. Nonetheless, the trending ability of {SV} {EIT} might be a promising alternative. The timing-based measurement of {PAP} is more robust to lung conductivity changes but sensitive to longitudinal belt displacements at severe hypertensive levels and to rotational displacements (independent of the {PAP} level). Significance: We identify and quantify the challenges of {EIT}-based {SV} and {PAP} monitoring. Absolute {SV} via {EIT} is challenging, but trending is feasible, while both the absolute and trending of {PAP} via {EIT} are mostly impaired by belt displacements.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) has undergone 30 years of development. Functional chest examinations with this technology are considered clinically relevant, especially for monitoring regional lung ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients and for regional pulmonary function testing in patients with chronic lung diseases. As {EIT} becomes an established medical technology, it requires consensus examination, nomenclature, data analysis and interpretation schemes. Such consensus is needed to compare, understand and reproduce study findings from and among different research groups, to enable large clinical trials and, ultimately, routine clinical use. Recommendations of how {EIT} findings can be applied to generate diagnoses and impact clinical decision-making and therapy planning are required. This consensus paper was prepared by an international working group, collaborating on the clinical promotion of {EIT} called {TRanslational} {EIT} {developmeNt} {stuDy} group. It addresses the stated needs by providing (1) a new classification of core processes involved in chest {EIT} examinations and data analysis, (2) focus on clinical applications with structured reviews and outlooks (separately for adult and neonatal/paediatric patients), (3) a structured framework to categorise and understand the relationships among analysis approaches and their clinical roles, (4) consensus, unified terminology with clinical user-friendly definitions and explanations, (5) a review of all major work in thoracic {EIT} and (6) recommendations for future development (193 pages of online supplements systematically linked with the chief sections of the main document). We expect this information to be useful for clinicians and researchers working with {EIT}, as well as for industry producers of this technology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These developments have excited interest in practitioners and researchers from a broad range of disciplines, including mathematicians devoted to uniqueness proofs and inverse problems, physicists dealing with bioimpedance, electronic engineerers involved in developing and extending its applications, and clinicians wishing to take advantage of this powerful new imaging method. With contributions from leading international researchers, Electrical Impedance Tomography: Methods, History and Applications provides an up-to-date review of the progress of {EIT}, the present state of knowledge, and a look at future advances and applications. Divided into four parts, the book presents an interdisciplinary approach. The first part discusses reconstruction algorithms while the second part describes the aspects of {EIT} instrumentation, including frequencies and electrodes. The third part features various {EIT} studies, such as breast cancer screening and artificial ventilation in intensive care units. The final part surveys new developments in magnetic induction tomography and magnetic resonance {EIT} ({MREIT}) as well as offers insight into three of the most productive and longstanding {EIT} research groups. The book also includes two nontechnical appendices that provide a brief and simple introduction to bioimpedance and the methods of {EIT}.Written in a style accessible to all related backgrounds, this reference will be helpful in establishing new methods and experiments of {EIT}, hopefully leading to radical breakthroughs in mainstream clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is of potential medical interest e.g., to optimize ventilator settings during mechanical ventilation. Nevertheless there are still several challenges. Although electrode belts are commonly used and promoted, they are not necessarily adequate for the long-term monitoring of patients in intensive-care units ({ICU}). {ICU} patients are usually equipped with breathing tubes and feeding tubes, ideal surfaces to attach {EIT} electrodes to. The aim of our study was therefore to examine the potentiality of internal electrodes in a porcine animal trial. Following an animal trial protocol studying acute lung injury, additional {EIT} measurements were obtained both with conventional electrodes set upon a rubber belt and after having moved the electrodes internally in seven pigs. For this reason the two most dorsally located electrodes were selected. An adjacent stimulation and measurement pattern was used, and resulting voltages in the time and frequency domains as well as within reconstructed images were examined to compare perfusion and ventilation data qualitatively and quantitatively. Particularly, lung morphology as well as signal strength for both the mediastinal and lung region were studied. All animals were submitted to the additional protocol without any adverse events. Distinguishability of lungs was improved in reconstructed frames. The resulting sensitivity of measured electrical impedance was enhanced around the mediastinal region and even cardiac-related activity was significantly increased by a factor of up to 6. In conclusion the application of internal electrodes appears to be beneficial for diverse clinical purposes and should be addressed in further studies.},

This method is a safe, inexpensive and potentially fast technique for cardiac output imaging but the spatial resolution is presently low, particularly for central locations such as the heart. Many parameters including noise deteriorate the reconstruction result. One of the main obstacles in cardiac imaging at the heart location is the high impedance of lungs and muscles on the dorsal and posterior side of body. In this study we are investigating improvements of the measurement and initial conductivity estimation of the internal electrode by modelling an internal electrode inside the esophagus. We consider 16 electrodes connected around a cylindrical mesh. With the random noise level set near 0.05\% of the signal we evaluated the Graz consensus reconstruction algorithm for electrical impedance tomography. The modelling and simulation results showed that the quality of the target in reconstructed images was improved by up to 5 times for amplitude response, position error, resolution, shape deformation and ringing effects with perturbations located in cardiac related positions when using an internal electrode.},

	abstract = {The conductivity distribution around the thorax is altered during the cardiac cycle due to the blood perfusion, heart contraction and lung inflation. Previous studies showed that these bio-impedance changes are appropriate for non-invasive cardiac function imaging using Electrical Impedance Tomography ({EIT}) techniques. However, the spatial resolution is presently low. One of the main obstacles in cardiac imaging at the heart location is the large impedance variation of the lungs by respiration and muscles on the dorsal and posterior side of the body. In critical care units there is a potential to insert an internal electrode inside the esophagus directly behind the heart in the same plane of the external electrodes. The aim of the present study is to evaluate different current stimulation and measurement patterns with both external and internal electrodes. Analysis is performed with planar arrangement of 16 electrodes for a simulated 3D cylindrical tank and pig thorax model. In our study we evaluated current injection patterns consisting of adjacent, diagonal, trigonometric, and radial to the internal electrode. The performance of these arrangements was assessed using quantitative methods based on distinguishability, sensitivity and {GREIT} (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for Electrical Impedance Tomography). Our evaluation shows that an internal electrode configuration based on the trigonometric injection patterns has better performance and improves pixel intensity of the small conductivity changes related to heart near 1.7 times in reconstructed images and also shows more stability with different levels of added noise. For the internal electrode, when we combined radial or adjacent injection with trigonometric injection pattern, we found an improvement in amplitude response. However, the combination of diagonal with trigonometric injection pattern deteriorated the shape deformation (correlation coefficientr=0.344) more than combination of radial and trigonometric injection (correlation coefficientr=0.836) for the perturbations in the area close to the center of the cylinder. We also find that trigonometric stimulation pattern performance is degraded in a realistic thorax model with anatomical asymmetry.

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) attempts to reconstruct the internal impedance distribution in a medium from electrical measurements at electrodes on the medium surface. One key difficulty with {EIT} measurements is due to the position uncertainty of the electrodes, especially for medical applications, in which the body surface moves during breathing and posture change. In this paper, we develop a new approach which directly reconstructs both electrode movements and internal conductivity changes for difference {EIT}. The reconstruction problem is formulated in terms of a regularized inverse, using an augmented Jacobian, sensitive to impedance change and electrode movement. A reconstruction prior term is computed to impose a smoothness constraint on both the spatial distribution of impedance change and electrode movement. A one-step regularized imaging algorithm is then implemented based on the augmented Jacobian and smoothness constraint. Images were reconstructed using the algorithm of this paper with data from simulated 2D and 3D conductivity changes and electrode movements, and from saline phantom measurements. Results showed good reconstruction of the actual electrode movements, as well as a dramatic reduction in image artefacts compared to images from the standard algorithm, which did not account for electrode movement.},

Electric field and voltage simulations are performed using two and four electrode configurations delivering a small alternating electric current to an anatomically realistic and electrically accurate model of modelled human torso. The simulations provide a three-dimensional electric field distribution and show that the time-varying blood conductivity alters the voltage potential difference between the electrodes by a maximum of 0.28\% for a cardiac output of about 5 L min−1. As part of a larger study, it is hoped that this initial model will be useful in providing improved insights into blood-flow-related spatiotemporal electric field variations and assist in the optimal placement of electrodes in impedance cardiography experiments.},

The resistivity of flowing blood is found to be a function of the shear rate profile. Under axisymmetric conditions shear rate profiles are a function of a single parameter: the reduced average velocity, which is the average velocity divided by the radius of the tube. The resistivity of human blood was investigated while the blood was in laminar flow in a circular tube with different constant flow rates. The relative change in resistivity in \% is given by: −0.45·H·\{1-exp[−0.26·(〈v〉/R)0.39]\}; where H is the packed cell volume in \% and 〈v〉/R is the reduced average velocity in s−1. In accelerating flow the resistivity change is synchronous with the change in flow rate, but in decelerating flow there is an exponential decay characterized by a relaxation time τ. For packed cell volumes of 36.4\% and 47.5\% τ was estimated to be 0.21 s, for a packed cell volume of 53.7\% τ was estimated to be 0.29 s. The resistivity changes in elastic tubes are influenced by both velocity changes and changes in diameter, but in opposite directions.},

Starting with the first paper on impedance cardiography in 1964, which assumed the lung was the source of the signal, the presentation will review many studies in the 60's, 70's and 80's, which suggest the aorta and other vessels as well as atria and again the lung as possible sources. Current studies based on high resolution thoracic models will be presented that show the aorta as contributing only approximately 1\% of the total impedance measurement, making it an unlikely candidate for the major contributor to the signal.

When used to measure lung ventilation, however, measurements depend both on conductivity changes in the thorax and on rib cage movement. Given that current reconstruction techniques assume that only conductivity changes are present, certain errors are introduced. We use a finite element model to calculate the effect of chest expansion on the reconstructed conductivity images. Results indicate that thorax expansion accounts for approximately 20 percent of the reconstructed image amplitude, and its contribution is relatively independent of inspiration depth. We propose that chest expansion can contribute significantly to the conductivity images of lung ventilation, and should be taken into account in interpreting these images.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	title = {Non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring by electrical impedance tomography},
	url = {https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/225621},
	abstract = {The monitoring of central hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output ({CO}) and pulmonary artery pressure ({PAP}) is of paramount clinical importance to assess the health status of the cardiovascular system. However, their measurement requires the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter, a highly invasive procedure associated with non-negligible morbidity and mortality rates. In this thesis, we investigated the clinical potential of electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) - a radiation-free medical imaging technique - as a non-invasive alternative for the measurement of {CO} and {PAP}. In a first phase, we investigated the potential of {EIT} for the measurement of {CO}. This measurement is implicitly based on the hypothesis that the {EIT} heart signal (the ventricular component of the {EIT} signals) is induced by ventricular blood volume changes. This hypothesis has never been formally investigated, and the exact origins of the {EIT} heart signal remain subject to interpretation. Therefore, using a model, we investigated the genesis of this signal by identifying its various sources and their respective contributions. The results revealed that the {EIT} heart signal is dominated by cardioballistic effects (heart motion). However, although of prominently cardioballistic origin, the amplitude of the signal has shown to be strongly correlated to stroke volume (r = 0.996, p \&lt; 0.001; error of 0.57 +/- 2.19 {mL}). We explained these observations by the quasi-incompressibility of myocardial tissue and blood. We further identified several factors and conditions susceptible to affect the accuracy of the measurement. Finally, we investigated the influence of the {EIT} sensor belt position on the measured heart signal. We observed that small belt displacements - likely to occur in clinical settings during patient handling - can induce errors of up to 30 {mL} on stroke volume estimation. In a second phase, we investigated the feasibility of a novel method for the non-invasive measurement of {PAP} by {EIT}. The method is based on the physiological relation linking the {PAP} to the velocity of propagation of the pressure waves in the pulmonary arteries. We hypothesized that the variations of this velocity, and therefore of the {PAP}, could be measured by {EIT}. In a bioimpedance model of the human thorax, we demonstrated the feasibility of our method in various types of pulmonary hypertensive disorders. Our {EIT}-derived parameter has shown to be particularly well-suited for predicting early changes in pulmonary hemodynamics due to its physiological link with arterial compliance. Finally, we validated experimentally our method in 14 subjects undergoing hypoxia-induced {PAP} changes. Significant correlation coefficients (range: [0.70, 0.98], average: 0.89) and small standard errors of the estimate (range: [0.9, 6.3] {mmHg}, average: 2.4 {mmHg}) were found between our {EIT}-derived systolic {PAP} and reference systolic {PAP} values obtained by Doppler echocardiography. In conclusion, there is a promising outlook for {EIT} in non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Our observations provide novel insights for the interpretation and understanding of {EIT} heart signals, and detail the physiological and metrological requirements for an accurate measurement of {CO} by {EIT}. Our novel {PAP} monitoring method, validated in vivo, allows a reliable tracking of {PAP} changes, thereby paving the way towards the development of a new branch of non-invasive hemodynamic monitors based on the use of {EIT}.},

We formulated a simple mathematical model of the {BCG} waveform. We showed that the model could predict the {BCG} waves as well as physiologic timings and amplitudes of the major waves. The validated model reveals that the principal mechanism for the genesis of the {BCG} waves is blood pressure gradients in the ascending and descending aorta.

The series of {EIT} scans of the momentary distribution of electrical impedance within the chest were obtained during each saline bolus administration at a rate of 13/s. {EBCT} scans were acquired at a rate of 3.3/s during bolus administrations of the radiopaque contrast material under the same steady-state conditions.

	abstract = {The existence of variations of normal human thoracic impedance, during the cardiac cycle to high frequency electrical current, is well known. Since the impedance variations within the thorax are synchronous with the electrocardiogram ({ECG}), they are attributed to cardiac activity. Recent advances in the clinical use of applied potential tomography ({APT}), or electrical impedance imaging, showed that the {APT} system gives a good soft-tissue contrast and has good sensitivity to resistivity changes. It is therefore concluded that the origin of thoracic impedance changes related to cardiac activity can be deduced from {APT} images. The authors' initial studies of {ECG} gated dynamic {APT} images of the thorax show that cardiac related thoracic impedance variations originating from different organs can be separated. Sequential {APT} images of the thorax during the cardiac cycle are presented. The movement of blood from the ventricles to the lungs and the vascular system and back to the ventricles is observable in these images. Limitations of the present {APT} system for monitoring cardiac related thoracic impedance changes and determining the cardiac parameters are summarised. The time relation between the mechanical activity of the heart and the variations in resistivity distribution within the thorax is discussed.},

	rights = {free\_to\_read},
	url = {https://eprints.qut.edu.au/39448/},
	abstract = {Impedance cardiography is an application of bioimpedance analysis primarily used in a research setting to determine cardiac output. It is a non invasive technique that measures the change in the impedance of the thorax which is attributed to the ejection of a volume of blood from the heart. The cardiac output is calculated from the measured impedance using the parallel conductor theory and a constant value for the resistivity of blood. However, the resistivity of blood has been shown to be velocity dependent due to changes in the orientation of red blood cells induced by changing shear forces during flow. The overall goal of this thesis was to study the effect that flow deviations have on the electrical impedance of blood, both experimentally and theoretically, and to apply the results to a clinical setting. The resistivity of stationary blood is isotropic as the red blood cells are randomly orientated due to Brownian motion. In the case of blood flowing through rigid tubes, the resistivity is anisotropic due to the biconcave discoidal shape and orientation of the cells. The generation of shear forces across the width of the tube during flow causes the cells to align with the minimal cross sectional area facing the direction of flow. This is in order to minimise the shear stress experienced by the cells. This in turn results in a larger cross sectional area of plasma and a reduction in the resistivity of the blood as the flow increases. Understanding the contribution of this effect on the thoracic impedance change is a vital step in achieving clinical acceptance of impedance cardiography. Published literature investigates the resistivity variations for constant blood flow. In this case, the shear forces are constant and the impedance remains constant during flow at a magnitude which is less than that for stationary blood. The research presented in this thesis, however, investigates the variations in resistivity of blood during pulsataile flow through rigid tubes and the relationship between impedance, velocity and acceleration. Using rigid tubes isolates the impedance change to variations associated with changes in cell orientation only. The implications of red blood cell orientation changes for clinical impedance cardiography were also explored. This was achieved through measurement and analysis of the experimental impedance of pulsatile blood flowing through rigid tubes in a mock circulatory system. A novel theoretical model including cell orientation dynamics was developed for the impedance of pulsatile blood through rigid tubes. The impedance of flowing blood was theoretically calculated using analytical methods for flow through straight tubes and the numerical Lattice Boltzmann method for flow through complex geometries such as aortic valve stenosis. The result of the analytical theoretical model was compared to the experimental impedance measurements through rigid tubes. The impedance calculated for flow through a stenosis using the Lattice Boltzmann method provides results for comparison with impedance cardiography measurements collected as part of a pilot clinical trial to assess the suitability of using bioimpedance techniques to assess the presence of aortic stenosis. The experimental and theoretical impedance of blood was shown to inversely follow the blood velocity during pulsatile flow with a correlation of -0.72 and -0.74 respectively. The results for both the experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the acceleration of the blood is an important factor in determining the impedance, in addition to the velocity. During acceleration, the relationship between impedance and velocity is linear (r2 = 0.98, experimental and r2 = 0.94, theoretical). The relationship between the impedance and velocity during the deceleration phase is characterised by a time decay constant, ô , ranging from 10 to 50 s. The high level of agreement between the experimental and theoretically modelled impedance demonstrates the accuracy of the model developed here. An increase in the haematocrit of the blood resulted in an increase in the magnitude of the impedance change due to changes in the orientation of red blood cells. The time decay constant was shown to decrease linearly with the haematocrit for both experimental and theoretical results, although the slope of this decrease was larger in the experimental case. The radius of the tube influences the experimental and theoretical impedance given the same velocity of flow. However, when the velocity was divided by the radius of the tube (labelled the reduced average velocity) the impedance response was the same for two experimental tubes with equivalent reduced average velocity but with different radii. The temperature of the blood was also shown to affect the impedance with the impedance decreasing as the temperature increased. These results are the first published for the impedance of pulsatile blood. The experimental impedance change measured orthogonal to the direction of flow is in the opposite direction to that measured in the direction of flow. These results indicate that the impedance of blood flowing through rigid cylindrical tubes is axisymmetric along the radius. This has not previously been verified experimentally. Time frequency analysis of the experimental results demonstrated that the measured impedance contains the same frequency components occuring at the same time point in the cycle as the velocity signal contains. This suggests that the impedance contains many of the fluctuations of the velocity signal. Application of a theoretical steady flow model to pulsatile flow presented here has verified that the steady flow model is not adequate in calculating the impedance of pulsatile blood flow. The success of the new theoretical model over the steady flow model demonstrates that the velocity profile is important in determining the impedance of pulsatile blood. The clinical application of the impedance of blood flow through a stenosis was theoretically modelled using the Lattice Boltzman method ({LBM}) for fluid flow through complex geometeries. The impedance of blood exiting a narrow orifice was calculated for varying degrees of stenosis. Clincial impedance cardiography measurements were also recorded for both aortic valvular stenosis patients (n = 4) and control subjects (n = 4) with structurally normal hearts. This pilot trial was used to corroborate the results of the {LBM}. Results from both investigations showed that the decay time constant for impedance has potential in the assessment of aortic valve stenosis. In the theoretically modelled case ({LBM} results), the decay time constant increased with an increase in the degree of stenosis. The clinical results also showed a statistically significant difference in time decay constant between control and test subjects (P = 0.03). The time decay constant calculated for test subjects (ô = 180 - 250 s) is consistently larger than that determined for control subjects (ô = 50 - 130 s). This difference is thought to be due to difference in the orientation response of the cells as blood flows through the stenosis. Such a non-invasive technique using the time decay constant for screening of aortic stenosis provides additional information to that currently given by impedance cardiography techniques and improves the value of the device to practitioners. However, the results still need to be verified in a larger study. While impedance cardiography has not been widely adopted clinically, it is research such as this that will enable future acceptance of the method.},

Typical sources of modelling errors include (pure) approximation errors related to numerical discretization, unknown geometry and boundary data, and possibly sensor locations. With electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}), the unknown contact impedances are an additional error source. Recently, a Bayesian approach to the treatment of approximation and modelling errors for inverse problems has been proposed. This approach has been shown to be applicable to a variety of modelling and approximation errors, at least with simulations. Recently, it was shown that recovery from significant model reduction and moderate mismodelling of geometry in {EIT} was also possible with laboratory {EIT} data. In this paper, we show that the errors due to the unknown contact impedances can also be compensated for by employing the approximation error approach. Furthermore, the recovery from simultaneous contact impedance, domain truncation and discretization-related errors is also feasible.},

	abstract = {Frequency-difference electrical impedance tomography ({fdEIT}) has been proposed to deal with technical difficulties of a conventional static {EIT} imaging method caused by unknown boundary geometry, uncertainty in electrode positions and other systematic measurement artifacts. In {fdEIT}, we try to produce images showing changes of a complex conductivity distribution with respect to frequency. Simultaneously injecting currents with at least two frequencies, we find differences of measured boundary voltages between those frequencies. In most previous studies, real parts of frequency-difference voltage data were used to reconstruct conductivity changes and imaginary parts to reconstruct permittivity changes. This conventional approach neglects the interplay of conductivity and permittivity upon measured boundary voltage data. In this paper, we propose an improved {fdEIT} image reconstruction algorithm that properly handles the interaction. It uses weighted frequency differences of complex voltage data and a complex sensitivity matrix to reconstruct frequency-difference images of complex conductivity distributions. We found that there are two major sources of image contrast in {fdEIT}. The first is a contrast in complex conductivity values between an anomaly and background. The second is a frequency dependence of a complex conductivity distribution to be imaged. We note that even for the case where conductivity and permittivity do not change with frequency, the {fdEIT} algorithm may show a contrast in frequency-difference images of complex conductivity distributions. On the other hand, even if conductivity and permittivity values significantly change with frequency, there is an example where we cannot find any contrast. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by using computer simulations to validate its feasibility in future experimental studies.},

Thus, {EIT} images are sensitive to electrode properties (i.e. contact impedance, electrode area and boundary shape under the electrode). While some of these electrode properties have been investigated individually, this paper investigates these properties and their interaction using finite element method simulations and the complete electrode model ({CEM}). The effect of conformal deformations on image reconstruction when using the {CEM} was of specific interest. Observed artefacts were quantified using a measure that compared an ideal image to the reconstructed image, in this case a no-noise reconstruction that isolated the electrodes’ effects. For electrode contact impedance and electrode area, uniform reductions to all electrodes resulted in ringing artefacts in the reconstructed images when the {CEM} was used, while parameter variations that were not correlated amongst electrodes resulted in artefacts distributed throughout the image. When the boundary shape changed under the electrode, as with non-symmetric conformal deformations, using the {CEM} resulted in structured distortions within the reconstructed image. Mean electrode contact impedance increases, independent of inter-electrode variation, did not result in artefacts in the reconstructed image.},

A reconstruction that incorporates electrode position estimates and conductivity can significantly reduce image artifacts. Conversely, if electrode position is ignored it can be difficult to distinguish true conductivity changes from reconstruction artifacts which may increase the risk of a flawed interpretation. Objective: In this work, we aim to determine the fastest, most accurate approach for estimating the electrode position Jacobian. Approach: Four methods of calculating the electrode position Jacobian were evaluated on a homogeneous halfspace.

	abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography ({EIT}) is very sensitive to deformations of the medium boundary shape. For lung imaging, breathing and changes in posture move the electrodes and change the chest shape, resulting in image artefacts. Several approaches have been proposed to improve the reconstructed images; most methods reconstruct both the boundary deformation and conductivity change from the measured data. These techniques require the calculation of the ‘movement Jacobian’, reflecting measurement changes due to the boundary deformation. Previous papers have calculated this Jacobian using perturbation techniques, which are slow (requiring multiple solutions of the forward problem) and become inaccurate with increasing finite element model size. This effect has limited reconstruction algorithms for deformable media to mostly 2D. To address this problem, we propose a direct method to calculate the Jacobian, based on a formulation of the derivatives of the finite element system matrix with respect to geometry changes. An illustrative example of these calculations is given, as well as a comparison between the proposed method and a perturbation method. Results show this method is ≈300 times faster; and for larger model sizes, the perturbation method begins to diverge from those from the direct method proposed.},

	abstract = {Impedance imaging is a technique where stimulus currents are applied through electrodes to a body or the ground and measurements of the potential at other electrodes are collected. The data, along with any available prior information, are used to reconstruct an image of the conductivity distribution throughout the interior which provides diagnostic, cost effective information upon which decisions can be based for a broad array of geophysics, biomedical and industrial applications. The same technique is known as (biomedical) Electrical Impedance Tomography ({EIT}) and (geophysics) Electrical Resistivity Tomography ({ERT}). New geophysical applications have arisen for the automated monitoring of slope stability risks for natural landslides, transport embankments and cuttings, mine tailings dams and piles, and remote infrastructure in changing climatic environments. When impedance imaging is used in challenging scenarios, image quality can suffer unless sources of data error and instability can be addressed. This work develops computational techniques to address the issue of data set stability under adverse measurement conditions and builds practical implementations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We seek to achieve images with fewer artifacts and better detectability through improved methods for addressing boundary movement which permit the use of this technology on unstable surfaces where the positions of electrodes can change over time. Processes are developed for evaluating the correctness of an implementation and the overall validity of reconstructed images. Results demonstrated by adapting well understood strategies show improved reconstruction quality for simulated and measured geophysics data sets.},
