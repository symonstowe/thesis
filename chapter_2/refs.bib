abstract = {Breathing moves volumes of electrically insulating air into and out of the lungs, producing conductivity changes which can be seen by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). It has thus been apparent, since the early days of EIT research, that imaging of ventilation could become a key clinical application of EIT. In this paper, we review the current state and future prospects for lung EIT, by a synthesis of the presentations of the authors at the 'special lung sessions' of the annual biomedical EIT conferences in 2009–2011. We argue that lung EIT research has arrived at an important transition. It is now clear that valid and reproducible physiological information is available from EIT lung images. We must now ask the question: How can these data be used to help improve patient outcomes? To answer this question, we develop a classification of possible clinical scenarios in which EIT could play an important role, and we identify clinical and experimental research programmes and engineering developments required to turn EIT into a clinically useful tool for lung monitoring.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an attractive method for clinically monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation, because it can provide a non-invasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance which indicates the distribution of ventilation. However, most clinical and physiological research in lung EIT is done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is an obstacle to interpretation of EIT images because the reconstructed images are not well characterized. To address this issue, we develop a consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT, called GREIT (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT). This paper describes the unified approach to linear image reconstruction developed for GREIT. The framework for the linear reconstruction algorithm consists of (1) detailed finite element models of a representative adult and neonatal thorax, (2) consensus on the performance figures of merit for EIT image reconstruction and (3) a systematic approach to optimize a linear reconstruction matrix to desired performance measures. Consensus figures of merit, in order of importance, are (a) uniform amplitude response, (b) small and uniform position error, (c) small ringing artefacts, (d) uniform resolution, (e) limited shape deformation and (f) high resolution. Such figures of merit must be attained while maintaining small noise amplification and small sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement. This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative group of experts in EIT algorithm design and clinical applications for pulmonary monitoring. All software and data to implement and test the algorithm have been made available under an open source license which allows free research and commercial use.},

Ideally, assessment of lung perfusion should be performed in real-time with an imaging technology that provides, through fast acquisition of sequential images, information about the regional dynamics or regional kinetics of an appropriate tracer. We present a novel electrical impedance tomography (EIT)-based method that quantitatively estimates regional lung perfusion based on first-pass kinetics of a bolus of hypertonic saline contrast. Pulmonary blood flow was measured in six piglets during control and unilateral or bilateral lung collapse conditions. The first-pass kinetics method showed good agreement with the estimates obtained by single-photon-emission computerized tomography (SPECT). The mean difference (SPECT minus EIT) between fractional blood flow to lung areas suffering atelectasis was -0.6{\%}, with a SD of 2.9{\%}. This method outperformed the estimates of lung perfusion based on impedance pulsatility. In conclusion, we describe a novel method based on EIT for estimating regional lung perfusion at the bedside. In both healthy and injured lung conditions, the distribution of pulmonary blood flow as assessed by EIT agreed well with the one obtained by SPECT. The method proposed in this study has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of regional perfusion under different lung and therapeutic conditions.},

Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) are parameters of key clinical interest. Many techniques exist to measure CO and SV, but are either invasive or insufficiently accurate in clinical settings. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been suggested as a noninvasive measure of SV, but inconsistent results have been reported. Our goal is to determine the accuracy and reliability of EIT-based SV measurements, and whether advanced image reconstruction approaches can help to improve the estimates. Data were collected on ten healthy volunteers undergoing postural changes and exercise. To overcome the sensitivity to heart displacement and thorax morphology reported in previous work, we used a 3D EIT configuration with 2 planes of 16 electrodes and subject-specific reconstruction models. Various EIT-derived SV estimates were compared to reference measurements derived from the oxygen uptake. Results revealed a dramatic impact of posture on the EIT images. Therefore, the analysis was restricted to measurements in supine position under controlled conditions (low noise and stable heart and lung regions). In these measurements, amplitudes of impedance changes in the heart and lung regions could successfully be derived from EIT using ECG gating. However, despite a subject-specific calibration the heart-related estimates showed an error of 0.0 ± 15.2 mL for absolute SV estimation. For trending of relative SV changes, a concordance rate of 80.9{\%} and an angular error of −1.0 ± 23.0° were obtained. These performances are insufficient for most clinical uses. Similar conclusions were derived from lung-related estimates. Our findings indicate that the key difficulty in EIT-based SV monitoring is that purely amplitude-based features are strongly influenced by other factors (such as posture, electrode contact impedance and lung or heart conductivity). All the data of the present study are made publicly available for further investigations.},

abstract = {In spontaneously breathing or ventilated subjects, it is difficult to image cardiac-related conductivity changes using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) due to the high amplitude of the ventilation component. Previous attempts to separate these components included either electrocardiogram-gated averaging, frequency domain filtering or holding the breath while performing the measurements. However, such methods are either not able to produce continuous real-time images or to fully separate cardiac and pulmonary changes. The aim of this work was to develop a new dynamic filtering method for the online separation of pulmonary and cardiac changes avoiding the drawbacks of the previous attempts. The approach is based on estimating template functions for the pulmonary and cardiac components by means of principal component analysis and frequency domain filtering. Then, these templates are fitted into the input signals. The new method enables an observer to examine the variation of the cardiac signal beat-by-beat after a one-time setup period of 20 s. Preliminary in vivo results of two healthy subjects are presented. The results are superior to frequency domain filtering and in good agreement with signals averaged over several cardiac cycles. The method does not depend on ECG or other a priori knowledge. The apparent validity of the method's ability to separate cardiac and pulmonary changes in EIT images was shown and has to be confirmed in future studies. The algorithm opens up new possibilities for future clinical trials on continuous monitoring by means of EIT and for the examination of the relation between the cardiac component and lung perfusion.},

Electrical impedance tomography {\{}(EIT){\}} can detect changes in impedance caused by pulmonary ventilation and perfusion, but the effect of changes in the position of the body and in the placing of the electrode belt on the impedance signal have not to our knowledge been thoroughly evaluated. We therefore studied ventilation-related and perfusion-related changes in impedance during spontaneous breathing in 10 healthy subjects in five different body positions and with the electrode belt placed at three different thoracic positions using a 32-electrode {\{}EIT{\}} system. We found differences between regions of interest that could be attributed to changes in the position of the body, and differences in impedance amplitudes when the position of the electrode belt was changed. Ventilation-related changes in impedance could therefore be related to changes in the position of both the body and the electrode belt. Perfusion-related changes in impedance were probably related to the interference of major vessels. While these findings give us some insight into the sources of variation in impedance signals as a result of changes in the positions of both the body and the electrode belt, further studies on the origin of the perfusion-related impedance signal are needed to improve {\{}EIT{\}} further as a tool for the monitoring of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion.},

The authors describe a gated EIT system to image the cardiogenic electrical resistivity variations and the results of in vivo studies on human subjects. It is shown that the sensitivity of EIT to tissue resistivity variations due to blood perfusion is good enough to image blood flow to the lungs; hence, abnormalities in pulmonary perfusion, such as pulmonary embolism, should appear in EIT images. In addition, more valuable information related to the cardiac activity can be gained from EIT images than from impedance cardiography. It is thus likely that a cardiac output index may be calculable from the average resistivity variations over the ventricles, but considerable research is required before the images can be understood in detail.},

The series of EIT scans of the momentary distribution of electrical impedance within the chest were obtained during each saline bolus administration at a rate of 13/s. EBCT scans were acquired at a rate of 3.3/s during bolus administrations of the radiopaque contrast material under the same steady-state conditions.

Functional chest examinations with this technology are considered clinically relevant, especially for monitoring regional lung ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients and for regional pulmonary function testing in patients with chronic lung diseases. As EIT becomes an established medical technology, it requires consensus examination, nomenclature, data analysis and interpretation schemes. Such consensus is needed to compare, understand and reproduce study findings from and among different research groups, to enable large clinical trials and, ultimately, routine clinical use. Recommendations of how EIT findings can be applied to generate diagnoses and impact clinical decision-making and therapy planning are required. This consensus paper was prepared by an international working group, collaborating on the clinical promotion of EIT called TRanslational EIT developmeNt stuDy group. It addresses the stated needs by providing (1) a new classification of core processes involved in chest EIT examinations and data analysis, (2) focus on clinical applications with structured reviews and outlooks (separately for adult and neonatal/paediatric patients), (3) a structured framework to categorise and understand the relationships among analysis approaches and their clinical roles, (4) consensus, unified terminology with clinical user-friendly definitions and explanations, (5) a review of all major work in thoracic EIT and (6) recommendations for future development (193 pages of online supplements systematically linked with the chief sections of the main document).

Volumetric EIT images using two (or more) electrode planes should help compensate, but are little used currently.

One shortcoming of the original formulation of GREIT is its restriction to reconstruction onto a 2D planar image. We present an extension of the GREIT algorithm to 3D and develop open-source tools to evaluate its performance as a function of the choice of stimulation and measurement pattern. Results show 3D GREIT using two electrode layers has significantly more uniform sensitivity profiles through the chest region. Overall, the advantages of 3D EIT are compelling.},

abstract = {Assessing peripheral vasculature health has the potential to impact clinical decision making in terms of treating patients with cardiovascular disease. The electrical conductivity of certain tissue regions within the forearm change as blood vessels undergo pulsatile dilation in synchrony with the beating of the heart. We use dynamic electrical impedance tomography (EIT) gated to the peak of a pulse oxymetry plethysmography waveform to image this temporally varying spatial conductivity. A phantom imaging experiment is presented showing that small conductivity changes of less than 1 mm are detectable using the developed dynamic EIT system. This system is used to image a volunteer's forearm during resting cardiovascular activity. Similar structures are observed in the plethysmography trace and the temporally varying conductivity. Spectral analysis shows that the maximum amplitude is occurring at frequencies of 1.19 Hz and 1.21 Hz for the plethysmography trace and conductivity trace, respectively. This preliminary data suggests that EIT may be sensitive enough to visualize cardiac-based pulsatility in the peripheral vessels of the forearm.},

abstract = {Introduction: The use of alveolar recruitment maneuvers during general anaesthesia of horses is a potentially useful therapeutic option for the ventilatory management. While the routine application of recruitments would benefit from the availability of dedicated large animal ventilators their impact on ventilation and perfusion in the horse is not yet well documented nor completely understood. Case history: A healthy 533 kg experimental horse underwent general anaesthesia in lateral recumbency. During intermittent positive pressure ventilation a stepwise alveolar recruitment maneuver was performed. Management: Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen using a large animal circle system. Mechanical ventilation was applied in pressure ventilation mode and an alveolar recruitment maneuver performed employing a sequence of ascending and descending positive end expiratory pressures. Next to the standard monitoring, which included spirometry, additionally three non-invasive monitoring techniques were used: electrical impedance tomography (EIT), volumetric capnography and respiratory ultrasonic plethysmography. The functional images continuously delivered by EIT initially showed markedly reduced ventilation in the dependent lung and allowed on-line monitoring of the dynamic changes in the distribution of ventilation during the recruitment maneuver. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of compliance, dead space fraction, tidal volumes and changes in end expiratory lung volume were possible without technical difficulties. Follow up: The horse made an unremarkable recovery. Conclusion: The novel non-invasive monitoring technologies used in this study provided unprecedented insights into the physiology of lung collapse and recruitment. The synergic information of these techniques holds promise to be useful when developing and evaluating new ventilatory strategies in horses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: A recently developed camera system for high-speed SPECT (HS-SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging shows excellent correlation with conventional SPECT. Our goal was to test the diagnostic accuracy of an automated quantification of combined upright and supine myocardial SPECT for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) ({\textgreater}= 70{\%} luminal diameter stenosis or, in left main coronary artery, {\textgreater}= 50{\%} luminal diameter stenosis) in comparison to invasive coronary angiography (ICA). METHODS: We studied 142 patients undergoing upright and supine HS-SPECT, including 56 consecutive patients (63{\%} men; mean age +/- SD, 64 +/- 13 y; 45{\%} exercise stress) without known CAD who underwent diagnostic ICA within 6 mo of HS-SPECT and 86 consecutive patients with a low likelihood of CAD. Reference limits for upright and supine HS-SPECT were created from studies of patients with a low likelihood of CAD. Automated software adopted from supine-prone analysis was used to quantify the severity and extent of perfusion abnormality and was expressed as total perfusion deficit (TPD). TPD was obtained for upright (U-TPD), supine (S-TPD), and combined upright-supine acquisitions (C-TPD). Stress U-TPD {\textgreater}= 5{\%}, S-TPD {\textgreater}= 5{\%}, and C-TPD {\textgreater}= 3{\%} myocardium were considered abnormal for per-patient analysis, and U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD {\textgreater}= 2{\%} in each coronary artery territory were considered abnormal for per-vessel analysis. RESULTS: On a per-patient basis, the sensitivity was 91{\%}, 88{\%}, and 94{\%} for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively, and specificity was 59{\%}, 73{\%}, and 86{\%} for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively. C-TPD had a larger area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve than U-TPD or S-TPD for identification of stenosis {\textgreater}= 70{\%} (0.94 vs. 0.88 and 0.89, P {\textless} 0.05 and not significant, respectively). On a per-vessel basis, the sensitivity was 67{\%}, 66{\%}, and 69{\%} for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively, and specificity was 91{\%}, 94{\%}, and 97{\%} for U-TPD, S-TPD, and C-TPD, respectively (P = 0.02 for specificity U-TPD vs. C-TPD). CONCLUSION: In this first comparison of HS-SPECT with ICA, new automated quantification of combined upright and supine HS-SPECT shows high diagnostic accuracy for detecting clinically significant CAD, with findings comparable to those reported using conventional SPECT.},

abstract = {ECG-gated electrical impedance tomographic spectroscopy (EITS) measurements of the lungs were taken on seven normal subjects in the frequency range 9.6 kHz to 614.4 kHz. The results show that in late systole the resistivity p' relative to the R-wave (i.e. p' = 1 at the R-wave) decreases consistently within the lung. In addition there arises an increase in p' in early systole towards the periphery of the lung. Frequency behaviour of p' changes with location. At all times after the R-wave, in the centre of the lung p' is higher at higher frequency f whereas in the periphery it is lower at higher f. The principal decrease in p' can be explained by increasing pulmonary blood volume due to cardiac contraction. The early systolic increase is presumably due to venous return to the left atrium locally leading blood output from the right ventricle which is delayed by the windkessel effect. Based on a model taking extracapillary and capillary blood volume increase into account, the change in frequency behaviour of p' is explained by regional variations in extracapillary blood vessel size determining the relative contributions of extracapillary blood volume and capillary blood volume change to p' at a certain frequency.},

abstract = {A study was conducted using the Sheffield electrical impedance tomography (EIT) portable system DAS-01 P to determine the change in the cardiac image with electrode position, lung volume and body position. Sixteen electrodes were positioned in three transverse planes around the thorax at the level of the second intercostal space, at the level of the xiphisternal joint, and midway between upper and lower locations. Data were collected at each electrode level with the breath held at end expiration and after inspiring 0.5, 1 and 1.5 l of air with the subject in both the supine and sitting position. These data were analysed using a Matlab developed program that calculates the average resistivity change in the cardiac region from automatically determined borders. Results show significant individual variability with electrode position and air volume. The middle electrode most consistently shows an increase in impedance in the region of the heart during systole. In some subjects the change in the ventricular-volume-like curve showed a greater than 50{\%} change as a function of lung volume. The pattern of variability with electrode position was not consistent among subjects. In one subject MRI images were obtained to compare actual structures with those seen in the EIT image. The results suggest that using these electrode locations reliable and consistent data, which could be used in clinical applications, cannot be obtained.},

A novel approach for the noninvasive and unsupervised monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in patients with PH was proposed and investigated. The approach was based on the use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), a noninvasive and safe monitoring technique, and was tested through simulations on a realistic 4D bio-impedance model of the human thorax. Changes in PAP were induced in the model by simulating multiple types of hypertensive conditions. A timing parameter physiologically linked to the PAP via the so-called pulse wave velocity principle was automatically estimated from the EIT data. It was found that changes in PAP could indeed be reliably monitored by EIT, irrespective of the pathophysiological condition that caused them. If confirmed clinically, these findings could open the way for a new generation of noninvasive PAP monitoring solutions for the follow-up of patients with PH.},

While much literature exists describing models for linear protein aggregation, such as amyloid fibril formation, there are few reports of models which address amorphous aggregation. Here, we propose a model to describe the amorphous aggregation of proteins which is also more widely applicable to other situations where a similar process occurs, such as in the formation of colloids and nanoclusters. As first applications of the model, we have tested it against experimental turbidimetry data of three proteins relevant to the wine industry and biochemistry, namely, thaumatin, a thaumatinlike protein, and alpha -lactalbumin. The model is very robust and describes amorphous experimental data to a high degree of accuracy. Details about the aggregation process, such as shape parameters of the aggregates and rate constants, can also be extracted.},

abstract = {Background Filling the lung with dense liquid perfluorocarbons during total liquid ventilation (TLV) might compress the myocardium, a plausible explanation for the instability occasionally reported with this technique. Our objective is to assess the impacts of TLV on the cardiovascular system, particularly left ventricular diastolic function, in an ovine model of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Method Eight newborns lambs, 3.0 +/- 0.4 days (3.2 +/- 0.3kg) were used in this crossover experimental study. Animals were intubated, anesthetized and paralyzed. Catheters were inserted in the femoral and pulmonary arteries. A high-fidelity pressure catheter was inserted into the left ventricle. Surfactant deficiency was induced by repeated lung lavages with normal saline. TLV was then conducted for 2 hours using a liquid ventilator prototype. Thoracic echocardiography and cardiac output assessment by thermodilution were performed before and during TLV. Results Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (9.3 +/- 2.1 vs. 9.2 +/- 2.4mmHg, p = 0.89) and dimension (1.90 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.86 +/- 0.12cm, p = 0.72), negative dP/dt (-2589 +/- 691 vs. -3115 +/- 866mmHg/s, p = 0.50) and cardiac output (436 +/- 28 vs. 481 +/- 59ml/kg/min, p = 0.26) were not affected by TLV initiation. Left ventricular relaxation time constant (tau) slightly increased from 21.5 +/- 3.3 to 24.9 +/- 3.7ms (p = 0.03). Mean arterial systemic (48 +/- 6 vs. 53 +/- 7mmHg, p = 0.38) and pulmonary pressures (31.3 +/- 2.5 vs. 30.4 +/- 2.3mmHg, p = 0.61) were stable. As expected, the inspiratory phase of liquid cycling exhibited a small but significant effect on most variables (i.e. central venous pressure +2.6 +/- 0.5mmHg, p = 0.001; LVEDP +1.18 +/- 0.12mmHg, p{\textless}0.001). Conclusions TLV was well tolerated in our neonatal lamb model of severe respiratory distress syndrome and had limited impact on left ventricle diastolic function when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 Sage et al.

abstract = {There is a strong clinical demand for devices allowing continuous non-invasive monitoring of central blood pressure (BP). In the state of the art a new family of techniques providing BP surrogates based on the measurement of the so-called pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been proposed, eliminating the need for inflation cuffs. PWV is defined as the velocity at which pressure pulses propagate along the arterial wall. However, no technique to assess PWV within central arteries in a fully unsupervised manner has been proposed so far. In this pilot study, we provide first experimental evidence that electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is capable of measuring pressure pulses directly within the descending aorta. To obtain a wide range of BP values, we administrated noradrenalin and nitroglycerine to an anesthetized pig under mechanical ventilation. An arterial line was inserted into the ascending aorta for measuring reference BP. EIT images were generated from 32 impedance electrodes placed around the chest at the level of the axilla. Regions of Interest (ROI) such as the descending aorta and the lungs were automatically identified by a novel time-based processing algorithm as the respective EIT pixels representing these structures. The correct positions of these ROIs were confirmed by bolus injections of highly conductive concentrated saline into the right heart and into the ascending aorta. Aortic pulse transit time (PTT) values were determined as the delay between the opening of the aortic valve (obtained from arterial line) and the arrival of pressure pulses at the aortic ROI within the EIT plane. For 11 experimental conditions, with mean BP ranging from 73 to 141 mmHg, strongly significant correlation (r = -0.97, P {\textless} 0.00001) between central BP and aortic PTT was observed, suggesting that EIT-derived aortic PTT is a potential non-invasive surrogate of central BP.},

Suggested solutions involve multiple time averaging of cardiac gated data or reconstructed images. The required number of data frames for this type of processing is large (at least 100 cardiac cycles). Because the ventilation and perfusion components of the resistivity signals are well separated in the frequency domain, they can be differentiated by filtering.
